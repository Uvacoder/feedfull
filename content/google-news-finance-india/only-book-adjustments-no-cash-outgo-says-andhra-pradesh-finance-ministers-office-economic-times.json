  "description": "The FMO blamed it all on the comprehensive financial management system (CFMS) put in place by the previous TDP (Telugu Desam Party) government. \"The CFMS has not been systemized. Hence, book adjustments were shown as special bills,\" it said. Also, the FMO evaded any reference to the observations of CAG on the financial mismanagement by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government and spending of public money to the tune of Rs 1.10 lakh crore in gross violation of the constitutional provisions.",
