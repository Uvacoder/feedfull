  "description": "“Going forward, the outlook looks very strong for HDFC twins, ICICI, Axis, SBI, all top four or five banks.  My view is it is the right time to build on all these five-six banking stocks. Maybe in the next couple of weeks, we will see some kind of stabilisation in FII selling as well. My view is the market will just stabilise and we will see some kind of bounce backs in all these financials.” ",
