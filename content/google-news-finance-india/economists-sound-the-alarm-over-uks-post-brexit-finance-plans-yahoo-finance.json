  "description": "More than 50 economists warned on Monday that Britain's post-Brexit plans to boost the competitiveness of its huge finance industry risked creating the kind of problems that led to the global financial crisis.  The government, seeking to use its \"Brexit freedoms\", announced this month that it would require regulators to help the City of London to remain a global financial centre after the country left the European Union.  The group of 58 economists, including a Nobel Prize winner and former business minister Vince Cable, said making competitiveness an objective could turn regulators into cheerleaders for banks and lead to poor policymaking.",
