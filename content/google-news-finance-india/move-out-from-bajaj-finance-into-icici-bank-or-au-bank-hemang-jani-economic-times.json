  "description": "“Bajaj Finance is a great franchise but it is quoting at seven times price to book on an FY23 basis and where growth is not looking good and more importantly, over the next one or two years, there is going to be a compression in margins. Our clear cut takeaway is to move out from Bajaj Finance and move into something like ICICI Bank or AU Bank where one is getting a good franchise at a reasonable valuation.”",
