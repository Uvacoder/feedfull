  "description": "Since the last three sessions, the Nifty has been trading in a tight range of 15,735-16,080. On the daily chart, the Nifty has made a bullish harami candlesticks pattern, with three identical bottoms exactly at crucial support of 15,700.“It means bears are losing steam. Any sort of short covering above 16,000 will take the index to 16,200-300. The expected range for the week is 15,700-16,300. At the current juncture, Daily MACD is displaying limited downside due to loss of momentum. Daily RSI is in the oversold zone,” Mehul Kothari, AVP - Technical Research, Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.Below are stocks that analysts recommend for Tuesday: Stock Ideas",
