  "description": "NCDs or non convertible debentures are nothing but bonds using which the corporates issue to raise fund. These are called non-convertible as for them there is no scope for conversion into equity or stocks. These are advantageous to fixed income investors as they offer a higher return, less risky and also offer tax benefits.",
