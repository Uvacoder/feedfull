Well, don’t everybody applaud all at once. It’s actually an amazing feat of science. Let’s start with a simple question. How do you demonstrate that reality is real? You can pinch yourself. But that only demonstrates that you’re capable of perceiving pain. Fictional characters can experience pain, so that doesn’t give us anything to go on. In fact, as I wrote in a recent Neural newsletter, we can’t be 100% sure we don’t live in a doppelganger universe or&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/new-experiment-demonstrates-reality-might-actually-be-real?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
