But it’s hard to know which ones will remain popular past their drops. A lot of them launch pictures for proof (PFP) NFTs — think of them as image NFTs — with no utility attached to them. And there’s no clear plan for holders as to what value these might bring them, beyond trading. It might be easy for project leaders to team up with an artist and drop some NFTs, but they’d need more technical prowess to create their own token and set up a governance mechanism.&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/co-create-a16z-nft-native-token-fundraise-analysis?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
