Rather than seeing who can go furthest (or who’s got the bigger rocket), the much more quiet revolution will be about looking inwards. The democratization of satellite monitoring and data is bringing about a new era in which technologies like geothermal heat mapping, satellite-based IoT capabilities, and risk mapping can be harnessed by individuals to solve our most pressing problems here on Earth.
