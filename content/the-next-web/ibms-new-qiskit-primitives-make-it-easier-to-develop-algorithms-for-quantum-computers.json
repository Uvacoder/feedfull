This assessment comes on the heels of Big Blue’s latest launch: two new Qiskit Runtime primitives debuting today (you read it here first). Quantum computing promises to do two things for society: help us solve today’s problems faster, and put us in a position to solve tomorrow’s problems. And whether those problems involve optimization, simulations, or needle-in-a-haystack searches, we’ll need computers powerful enough to solve them. But we’ll also need cloud infrastructure, software, and all kinds of interfaces between&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/ibms-new-qiskit-primitives-make-easier-develop-algorithms-quantum-computers?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/company/ibm\">IBM</a>",
