Artificial intelligence research has made great achievements in solving specific applications, but weâ€™re still far from the kind of general-purpose AI systems that scientists have been dreaming of for decades. Among the solutions being explored to overcome the barriers of AI is the idea of neuro-symbolic systems that bring together the best of different branches of computer science. In a talk at the IBM Neuro-Symbolic AI Workshop, Joshua Tenenbaum, professor of computational cognitive science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explained how neuro-symbolic systems can help to&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/neuro-symbolic-ai-closer-machines-with-common-sense?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
