After a series of prototypes and “more than 1,500” test flights, the company has developed the full-size pre-production prototype of its air taxi — named VoloCity. On Wednesday, Volocopter released footage of VoloCity’s maiden flight, which you can watch on the video above. The flight, which took place in December 2021, shows the aircraft taking off, hovering above the ground for one minute, and then successfully landing, remotely piloted by the operators with no people onboard.
