In Hawking’s view, the discovery of black hole physics confirmed that not only did God play dice, “but that he sometimes confuses us by throwing them where they can’t be seen.” Are we here by chance or design? A more pragmatic approach to the question, considering the subject matter, would be to assume that all answers are correct. In fact, that’s the basis of quantum physics. Here’s the simplest explanation of how it all works that you’ll ever read: imagine flipping a&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/regular-persons-guide-mind-blowing-world-hybrid-quantum-computing?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
