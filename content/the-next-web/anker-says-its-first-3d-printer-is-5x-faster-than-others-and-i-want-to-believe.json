But it also kind of sucks. 3D printing allows you to build all sorts of gadgets and gizmos, fix things without having to locate specialty components, and solve problems you didn’t even realize you had. You can build sporks! Folding coat hangers! Ratchet wrenches! Wheelchairs for dogs! If it has a shape, you can probably print it. But 3D printing is slow.
