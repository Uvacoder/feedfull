An international team of researchers led by Cambridge University’s Richard Bethlehem recently published the world’s first growth chart for brains. Up front: How are you supposed to tell if your brain is growing properly? It’s an important question. And we’ve had no answer until now. Most people don’t spend their lives connected to brain imaging devices. And that means we probably have no clue if our brain is average size and&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/your-brain-shrinks-you-age-now-scientists-can-prove-it?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
