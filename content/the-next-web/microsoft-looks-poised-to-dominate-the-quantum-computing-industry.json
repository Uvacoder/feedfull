According to the Redmond company, this will allow it to build scalable quantum computers capable of solving the hardest problems facing humanity. So, is this a breakthrough for the field or just an attempt to lean in to the marketing zeitgeist surrounding quantum computing? To sort out the answer, we’ll need to take a look at Microsoft’s quantum computing department, its history, and what it’s actually trying to accomplish.
