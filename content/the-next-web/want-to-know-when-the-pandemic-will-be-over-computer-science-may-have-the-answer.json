So, what’s the answer? What criteria should be used to determine the “end” of Covid’s pandemic phase? These are deceptively simple questions and there are no easy answers. I am a computer scientist who investigates the development of ontologies. In computing, ontologies are a means to formally structure knowledge of a subject domain, with its entities, relations, and constraints, so that a computer can process it in various applications and help humans&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/when-pandemic-will-be-over-computer-science-may-have-answer?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
