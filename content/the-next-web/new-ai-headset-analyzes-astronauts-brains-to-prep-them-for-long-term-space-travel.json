The device will fly to the International Space Station (ISS) for a first-of-its-kind experiment. The mission? Analyzing the neurological activity of astronauts to understand how microgravity affects the brain.  The headset was designed by brain.space, an Israeli company that’s come out of stealth mode for the project. Image: brain.space There is still little known about the effects of space travel on the brain. While astronauts are typically measured for various physiological changes, from heart rate to muscle mass, there is&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/brainspace-headset-will-analyze-changes-to-astronaut-brains-in-space-at-iss?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
