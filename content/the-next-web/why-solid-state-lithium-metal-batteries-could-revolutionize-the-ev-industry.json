They’re flammable, their range is still limited, and they’re not as quick to charge as we’d like them to be. Making EVs more competitive with gas-guzzlers will require remedies for these issues, and to achieve this we need a breakthrough in battery technology. That’s where lithium-metal batteries come in. How do lithium-metal batteries differ from lithium-ion ones? Both battery types use lithium to produce electrical energy and have a similar overall structure. Simply put, they have an anode (the battery’s negative&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/solid-state-lithium-metal-ev-batteries-could-revolutionize-ev-industry?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
