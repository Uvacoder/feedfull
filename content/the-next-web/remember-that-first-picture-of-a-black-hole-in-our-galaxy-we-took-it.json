Originally studied as a mere mathematical consequence of the theory rather than as physically relevant objects, they soon became thought of as generic and sometimes inevitable outcomes of the gravitational collapse that initially forms a galaxy. In fact, most physicists have suspected that our own galaxy revolves around a supermassive black hole at its center. There are other ideas too – such as “dark matter” (an invisible substance thought to make up most of the matter in the universe).
