To solve the charging time conundrum, a team of scientists from the Center for Theoretical Physics of Complex Systems at IBS has turned to the realm of quantum physics. The team drew inspiration from a 2012 study, which proposed a “quantum battery concept,” meaning a quantum mechanical system that acts as an energy storage device. According to the 2021 study and numerous others that followed (for instance, here, here, and here), thanks to quantum resources, quantum batteries&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/quantum-charging-ev-batteries-could-juice-cars-faster-than-pumping-gas?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
