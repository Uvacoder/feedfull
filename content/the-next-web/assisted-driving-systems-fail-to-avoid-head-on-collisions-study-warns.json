ADAS systems are widely available — and are often called semi-autonomous, as they combine automatic vehicle acceleration with braking and steering. The AAA tested three different ADAS-equipped vehicles: a 2020 Tesla Model 3 with Autopilot, a 2021 Subaru Forester with EyeSight, and a Hyundai Santa Fe with Highway Driving Assist.
