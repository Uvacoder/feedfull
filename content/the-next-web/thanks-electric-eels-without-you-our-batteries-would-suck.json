Italian physicist Alessandro Volta tapped into fundamental electrochemical principles when he invented the first battery in 1800. Essentially, the physical joining of two different materials, usually metals, generates a chemical reaction that results in the flow of electrons from one material to the other. That stream of electrons represents portable energy that can be harnessed to generate power. The first materials people employed to make batteries were copper and zinc. Today’s best batteries – those that produce&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/electric-eels-inspire-the-future-of-electric-batteries?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
