Elon flew in to cut the ribbon as the first 30 vehicles produced at the facility were handed over to customers.  The event was hosted by Andre Traurig, vehicle manufacturing lead at Tesla, and included a speech by Elon Musk, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Economy Minister Robert Habeck, and Brandenburg Prime Minister, Dietmar Woidke in attendance. Big props to Tobia King who filmed and translated the opening speeches.
