That’s because silicon has a theoretical energy capacity 10 times higher than that of graphite, meaning it can significantly increase an EV’s range. It can also absorb lithium-ions much quicker during charging — speeding up the process. But adding silicon to the anode comes with certain challenges. The material’s tendency to expand approximately 400% of its original size during the charging cycle can cause the silicon particles&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/4-types-of-silicon-tech-that-will-revolutionize-ev-batteries?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
