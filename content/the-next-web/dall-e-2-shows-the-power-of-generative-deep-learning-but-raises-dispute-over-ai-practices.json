Artificial intelligence research lab OpenAI made headlines again, this time with DALL-E 2, a machine learning model that can generate stunning images from text descriptions. DALL-E 2 builds on the success of its predecessor DALL-E and improves the quality and resolution of the output images thanks to advanced deep learning techniques. The announcement of DALL-E 2 was accompanied by a social media campaign by OpenAI’s engineers and its CEO, Sam Altman, who shared wonderful photos created by the generative machine learning model on Twitter. DALL-E 2 shows how far&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/dall-e-2-shows-power-of-generative-deep-learning-but-raises-dispute-over-ai-practices?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
