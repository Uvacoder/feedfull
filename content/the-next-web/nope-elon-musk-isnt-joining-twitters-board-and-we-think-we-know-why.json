On Sunday, the platform’s CEO announced that Elon won’t be accepting a seat on its board after all. That’s just five days after the celebrity billionaire bought a 9.2% stake of Twitter — making him the biggest shareholder of the company — and was appointed a board member. Take a look at CEO Parag Agrawal’s announcement: Elon has decided not to join our board. I sent a brief note to the company, sharing with you all here. pic.twitter.com/lfrXACavvk — Parag Agrawal (@paraga) April 11, 2022 According&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/elon-musk-isnt-joining-twitter-board-we-think-we-know-why?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/company/twitter-3\">Twitter</a>",
