Yep, you read that right. Musk said the company has to prove that bots consist of less than 5% of users on the platform. This comes after a Twitter filing with SEC earlier this month, that claimed that the number of bots and spam accounts in its daily active users count — 229 million in Q1 2022 — is less than 5%. Removing bots from Twitter was one of the Tesla CEO’s most advertised pitches when he was trying to take over the company.&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/elon-musk-twitter-deal-hold-bots?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/company/twitter-3\">Twitter</a>",
