The rings were unlike anything seen before, and we had no idea what they were. We dubbed them odd radio circles or ORCs. They continue to puzzle us, but new data from South Africa’s MeerKAT telescope are helping us solve the mystery. We can now see each ORC is centered on a galaxy too faint to be detected earlier. The circles are most likely enormous explosions of hot gas, about a million light-years across, emanating from the central galaxy.&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/ghostly-sky-circles-baffled-astronomers-explosions-from-distant-galaxies?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
