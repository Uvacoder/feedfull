For that reason, some automakers, like Tesla and Kia, have removed them from their models. Others, such as BMW, have kept them as part of their brands’ design identity. But why are radiator grilles pointless in electric cars? Let’s first remember their purpose in conventional vehicles. The grille is there to enable constant ventilation and to allow the outside air to reach the radiator, which cools down the engine.
