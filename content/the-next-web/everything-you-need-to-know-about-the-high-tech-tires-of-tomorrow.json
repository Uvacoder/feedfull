Technology, materials science, and engineering are creating longer-lasting, more resilient, more sustainable tires.  Let’s take a look at some of the latest trends: Airless A prototype of the airless tire. Credit: The Tire Company The SMART Tire Company is working to create “super elastic” airless tires in partnership with NASA. SMART stands for Shape Memory Alloy Radial Technology. And the tires are something special. They’re made of NiTinol+ (nickel-titanium), a shape memory alloy that’s elastic like rubber,&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/the-evolution-of-next-generation-tires?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
