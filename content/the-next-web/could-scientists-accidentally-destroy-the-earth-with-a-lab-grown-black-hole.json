But, since it’s black hole week at NASA, we thought we’d have a little fun imagining the complete and accidental annihilation of our planet. Back in the 1930s, there was a brief moment when some of the physicists working with Einstein on the atom bomb stopped to wonder if exploding such a device would end up lighting the Earth’s atmosphere on fire and destroying the entire planet.
