It’s convenient, the novels sync across my various devices, and, importantly, I can read at night without disturbing my partner. There is one deeply frustrating element of Amazon’s ereader, though: Popular Highlights. I’m certain you’re aware of them already, but just in case you aren’t, they’re sections of text in a book that are underlined. The idea is to crowdsource the most impactful and interesting sentences and paragraphs. And when enough people highlight that bit of text in a book, your Kindle decides it’s time to let you know. The problem is it’s awful.&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/how-to-turn-off-popular-highlights-amazon-kindle?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/topic/kindle\">Kindle</a>",
