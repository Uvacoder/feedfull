To that end, California-based startup OneD Battery Sciences has produced silicon nanowires that can be fused directly onto the commercial graphite particles found in the anodes of batteries. The impact? Potentially tripling the energy density of the anode, reducing charging times, and lowering the overall cost of the battery. Why silicon could be a game changer According to research by the PNNL Laboratory, silicon has a theoretical energy capacity&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/silicon-nanowires-promise-better-lithium-ion-ev-batteries?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
