It’s the company’s first SUV, and while such vehicles don’t usually get called beautiful, this time I’ll call it: the Eletre is a slick-looking machine, which seems like a hell of a package. Feast your eyes:   As you can see above, the EV isn’t beautiful in a conventional way. Its design language is rather aggressive with a cab-forward stance, long wheelbase, and short overhangs. Its front also looks like an angry reptile of sorts. Still, there’s a distinctive elegance somewhere in there.
