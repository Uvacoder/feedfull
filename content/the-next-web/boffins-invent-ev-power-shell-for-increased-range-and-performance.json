A team of researchers from the University of Central Florida (UCF) and NASA has designed a special power suit that’s giving “superpowers” not to us — but to our EVs. Made of layered carbon composite material and nanoscale graphene sheets, the suit works as a supercapacitor-battery hybrid device, able to store and provide energy. It’s envisioned to be used as a car’s body shell, which you can see in the image below: The cover of the&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/boffins-invent-ev-power-shell-for-increased-range-performance?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
