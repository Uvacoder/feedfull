Last year’s time crystals breakthrough was the culmination of decades of academic effort from the Search giant, and it proved Big G is a clear front-runner in the world of cutting-edge quantum physics research. Despite having virtually no B2B presence in the quantum computing marketplace, the Mountain View company managed to leverage itself as one of the most important players in the field. Google’s position comes as a bit of a surprise when you consider the competition. D-Wave’s been making quantum computers for about as long as Google has been&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/google-wants-win-quantum-computing-race-tortoise-not-hare?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/company/google\">Google</a>",
