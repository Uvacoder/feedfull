Considering that computers canâ€™t taste booze, this makes for a curious use-case for machine learning. The AI sommelier was trained on a database containing hundreds of thousands of beer and wine reviews. In essence, it aggregates those reviews and picks out keywords. When the researchers ask it to generate its own review for a specific wine or beer, it generates something similar to previous reviews. According to the researchers, its output is comparable to, and often indistinguishable from, reviews created purely by humans.
