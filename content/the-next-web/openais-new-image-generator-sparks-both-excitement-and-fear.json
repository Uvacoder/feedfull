Named DALL-E 2, the system is the successor to a model unveiled last year. While its predecessor generated some impressive outputs, the new version is a major upgrade. This picture in the style of Claude Monet illustrates the improvements. Credit: OpenAI DALL-E-2 adds enhanced textual comprehension, faster image generation, and four times greater resolution. “When approaching DALL-E 2 we focused on improving the image resolution quality and improving latency, rather than building a bigger system,” OpenAI researcher Aditya Ramesh told TNW.
