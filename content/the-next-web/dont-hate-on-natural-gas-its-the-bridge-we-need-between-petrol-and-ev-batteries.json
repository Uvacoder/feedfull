We need more time to make the tech work and, in the interim, a stepping stone fuel between gasoline and electric batteries. That’s where natural gas comes in. Comprising methane as its primary component, natural gas is an intriguing alternative to regular fuel. It’s abundant, has an established distribution network, a high hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, and, in turn, moderate carbon emissions compared to gasoline.
