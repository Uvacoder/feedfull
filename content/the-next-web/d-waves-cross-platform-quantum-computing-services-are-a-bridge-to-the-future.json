You can dispute whether Daniel Craig’s turn as an alien-fighting gold thief with amnesia is worthy of such high praise, but there’s no debating that D-Wave’s a bonafide pioneer in the world of quantum computing. Dubbed the “D-Wave One” (two years before the Xbox One gaming system came out), the company’s first production model was a quantum annealing system&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/d-waves-cross-platform-quantum-computing-services-bridge-to-the-future?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
