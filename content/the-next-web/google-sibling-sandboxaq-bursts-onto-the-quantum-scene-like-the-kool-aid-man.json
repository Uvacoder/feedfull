There weren’t any announcements and there wasn’t any fanfare. It just sort of happened. One day we were in the deep learning era and the next we’d gone quantum. If we had to put a date on it, here at Neural we’d choose 22 March, 2022. That’s the day SandboxAQ slipped out of stealth mode and starbursted out of the Alphabet (Google) research blanket. There’s a certain risk involved in attaching such significance to a relatively unknown company. And SandboxAQ isn’t exactly building iPhones or autonomous vehicles.
