That might sound like something out of a science fiction B-movie, but it’s legit peer-reviewed research. Up front: Previous attempts at controlling the weather have paid off with minimum success. Currently, if we find some big fat rain clouds ready to burst, we can preempt them by seeding them to cause precipitation. But the RIKEN team is talking about an entirely different level of control.
