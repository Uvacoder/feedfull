Horrendously ugly and ludicrously pricey, their value derives from artificial scarcity. It would be a great shame if someone offered infinite free versions of the collectibles — which is exactly what Yannic Kilcher has done. The machine learning expert has built an app that generates as many Bored Apes as your heart desires.
