The company ended a week that introduced a new enterprise GPU and an Arm-based “superchip” with a trademark flashy demo. Some 75 years after the world’s first instant photo captured the 3D world in a 2D picture, Nvidia showcased the inverse: turning 2D images into a 3D scene within milliseconds. Dubbed Instant NeRF, the technique involves training a neural rendering model on a few dozen still photos, alongside data on the camera angle for each shot.
