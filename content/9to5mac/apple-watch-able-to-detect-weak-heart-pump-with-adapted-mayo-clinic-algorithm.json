This algorithm will be able to detect a weak heart pump straight from these EKG tests. This could possibly detect life-threatening conditions earlier in users, without being in a medical setting. </p><p> <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/05/02/apple-watch-weak-heart-pump-algorithm/#more-802535\" class=\"more-link\">more…</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/05/02/apple-watch-weak-heart-pump-algorithm/\">Apple Watch able to detect weak heart pump with adapted Mayo Clinic algorithm</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com\">9to5Mac</a>.</p>",
