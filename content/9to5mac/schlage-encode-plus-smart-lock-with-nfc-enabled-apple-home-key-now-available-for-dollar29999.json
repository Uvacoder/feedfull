With standard <a href=\"https://www.9to5mac.com/guides/HomeKit/\">HomeKit</a> support in tow, in addition to new NFC-powered Apple home key support, it’s easy for me to recommend the Encode Plus as the best smart lock for Apple users.</p><p>The only lingering question from my hands-on review was release timing. Up until now, Schlage would only note that its flagship smart lock was arriving this spring, but we now know the exact date of its release and availability. The Encode Plus is available to purchase starting today at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3qR3VlT\">homedepot.com</a> for $299.99.</p><p> <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/31/schlage-encode-plus-smart-lock-nfc-apple-home-key-iphone-watch-available-today-300-home-depot-build-com/#more-795878\" class=\"more-link\">more…</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/31/schlage-encode-plus-smart-lock-nfc-apple-home-key-iphone-watch-available-today-300-home-depot-build-com/\">Schlage Encode Plus smart lock with NFC-enabled Apple home key now available for $299.99</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com\">9to5Mac</a>.</p>",
