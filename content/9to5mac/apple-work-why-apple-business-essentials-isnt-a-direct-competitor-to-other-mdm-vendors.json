I’ve talked to many companies who manage Macs and iPads, and they’re not interested in the service. This is a good thing though. Apple isn’t looking to control 100% of the device management market. Companies like <a href=\"https://www.kandji.io/\">Kandji</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com\">Jamf</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mosyle.com\">Mosyle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jumpcloud.com\">JumpCloud</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.addigy.com\">Addigy</a> do a great job of enabling Apple to work great in the enterprise. The enemy of Apple Business Essentials isn’t other MDM vendors. It’s unmanaged devices.</p><p> <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/05/21/why-apple-business-essentials-isnt-competing-against-other-mdm-vendors/#more-802239\" class=\"more-link\">more…</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/05/21/why-apple-business-essentials-isnt-competing-against-other-mdm-vendors/\">Apple @ Work: Why Apple Business Essentials isn&#8217;t a direct competitor to other MDM vendors</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com\">9to5Mac</a>.</p>",
