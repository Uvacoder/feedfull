  "description": "A 13-year-old boy in a wheelchair was denied boarding by IndiGo airline at Ranchi airport on Saturday. The denial sparked a backlash on social media, prompting the airline to make special arrangements to fly out the teenager and his parents to Hyderabad the next morning. The boy was deemed a threat to fellow passengers. An IndiGo employee misbehaved with the boy's parents when they protested. The boy was in a wheelchair.  All his fellow passengers, including doctors, requested the IndiGo employee to allow the boy on the flight. According to one social media post, the boy was distraught after a long drive to the airport, but had calmed down, after his parents soothed him. But when the time came to board the flight, the IndiGo employee allegedly said the teenager wouldn’t be allowed to travel as his behaviour could threaten others on the plane. On Sunday, IndiGo issued a statement claiming that the boy had been 'in a state of panic', and, in view of the safety of passengers, was not allowed to board the aircraft. Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Monday warned IndiGo airlines after the spiralling backlash. \"There is zero tolerance towards such behaviour. No human being should have to go through this! Investigating the matter by myself, post which appropriate action will be taken,\" the minister tweeted. IndiGo CEO Rono Dutta regretted the incident and offered to buy an electric wheelchair for the kid.",
