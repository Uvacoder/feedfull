  "description": "This old video of PM Modi from 2014 is now going viral as the rupee fell to a record low. The rupee breached the 77-level against the dollar for the first time on May 9. The slump saw Congress leaders sharing old videos of BJP politicians including that of late Sushma Swaraj who had equated the fall in rupee to a drop in prestige for the country. ",
