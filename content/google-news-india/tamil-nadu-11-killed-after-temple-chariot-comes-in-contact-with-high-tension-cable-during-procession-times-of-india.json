  "description": "In a shocking incident, at least 11 people including three boys have died of electrocution during a temple festival in Tamil Nadu's Thanjavur district.  The temple chariot came in contact with a high voltage electric cable during a chariot procession at Appar Swamy Mutt at Kalimedu. Police sources said that the chariot caught fire when it came in contact with the live wire.The Thanjavur collector and inspector general of police, central zone were taking stock of the situation. The nine-foot-high chariot was decorated with flowers and lights. The chariot was connected to a power generator electricity supply. The deceased included a generator operator. People mistook the electric spark for an ordinary fire and tried to put it out by pouring water, forgetting that water conducts electricity. Police noted that if they had not tried to douse the blaze with water, the death toll would have been lower. The Tamil Nadu CM has announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for families of those who died. ",
