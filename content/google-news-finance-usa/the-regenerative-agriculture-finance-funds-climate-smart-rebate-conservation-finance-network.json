  "description": "This January, Environmental Defense Fund and Farmers Business Network launched the pilot Regenerative Agriculture Finance Fund (RAFF). Enrolled farmers who meet EDF's soil health and nitrogen efficiency standards will access a 0.5% discount on the base rate of a one-year line of credit. This product, years in the making, responds to inefficiencies in todayâ€™s farm financing.",
