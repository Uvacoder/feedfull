  "description": "Airbnb Co-Founder Brian Chesky launched his company in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, born in part by a desire to make some extra cash with former roommate and co-founder Joe Gebbia.\n\nThe economy was so bad then, Chesky said Y Combinator Co-Founder Paul Graham warned him “there may be no investors” on Demo Day.\n\nWith technology stocks in the midst of their worst sell-off since 2008, Chesky said similar upstarts should brace for a correction “more profound” than the changes seen 14 years ago.",
