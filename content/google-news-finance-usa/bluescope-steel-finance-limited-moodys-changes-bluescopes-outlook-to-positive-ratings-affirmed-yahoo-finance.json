  "description": "Rating Action: Moody's changes BlueScope's outlook to positive; ratings affirmedGlobal Credit Research - 21 Mar 2022Sydney, March 21, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the Baa3 issuer rating of BlueScope Steel Limited.  The change also reflects: 1) the near completion of the expansion of its North Star facilities in the US, which has been able to be more than adequately funded with internally generated cash flow; 2) further clarity around the company's future growth ambitions and current plans for its Australian blast furnace, and; 3) a further demonstration of consistently conservative financial policies including a communicated willingness to operate below its already conservative net debt target as it funds further growth, a re-line of its Australian blast furnace, and ESG initiatives.BlueScope's Baa3 ratings continues to reflect the company's (1) good geographic and operational diversification with a very strong market and brand position in Australia and a highly profitable and growing presence in North America; (2) favorable industry dynamics translating into earnings expansion and supporting large free cash flow generation; (3) focus on value-add and downstream production that provides better returns and more resilience to weaker macroeconomic conditions; and (4) conservative financial policies with very strong credit metrics.The company's credit profile is balanced by: (1) its smaller scale relative to other similarly rated global peers; (2) its exposure to the volatility in the steel industry, including disruptions in global trade conditions and volatile input costs; (3) foreign exchange risk, and; (4) the cyclical nature of the company's end-markets, primarily residential and commercial construction.",
