The search giant calls small modular features like these “smart chips,” and they’re part of the “smart canvas” initiative <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440226/google-workspace-smart-canvas-features-docs-updates\">it launched last year</a>. The features are rolling out over the course of this month across all Google Account tiers. </p><p id=\"O2ryFG\">The dropdown tool lets you insert a small dropdown menu into a Google Doc, with a list of customizable options to choose from. Meanwhile, there are also new table template options that can be used to quickly add nicely formatted tables into a document. It looks like a huge improvement from Google Docs’ current barebones table creation feature.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XPq3vWmpyyqSgdx29CPMaOAMmco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23434997/unnamed_2.gif\">      <cite>Image: Google</cite>      <figcaption><em>The dropdown menus in action.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"CDfAXj\">Between them, they can be used to quickly create a simple project management document like those offered by productivity tools like Notion, directly within Google Docs. No longer is Docs designed around the idea that you’re typing out a document that you’ll eventually print. Instead, recent features see its documents serving more as collaboration tools for remote workers. </p><p id=\"cw9Jl9\">After years of remaining relatively unchanged, Google has been rapidly releasing new features for Docs in recent months. It announced new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22935824/google-workspace-pageless-smart-canvas-ai-sheets-office-docs-sheets\">pageless formatting in February</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23002138/google-docs-markdown-support-formatting-update\">Markdown support</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22980693/google-docs-gmail-draft-smart-canvas-chips\">ability to seamlessly draft emails in March</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/6/23012839/google-docs-emoji-reactions\">emoji reactions in April</a>. The new options are both available from the Insert menu, where you’ll find an option for “Dropdown” or “Table templates” within the “Table” submenu. </p>",
