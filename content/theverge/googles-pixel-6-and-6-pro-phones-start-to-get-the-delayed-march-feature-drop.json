Google previously rolled out the update to the Pixel 3A and 5A on March 7th but decided to push back the update for Pixel 6 devices to address bug fixes, according to <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/march-2022-pixel-feature-drop-update/\"><em>Android Police</em></a>.</p><p id=\"9IpsfG\">Several Pixel 6 owners here at <em>The Verge</em> are now able to download the update simply by checking for it on their phones. The 490MB patch on the Pixel 6 updates its version number to SP2A.220305.013.A3.</p><p id=\"6UIeLe\"><a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/feature-drop-march-2022/\">March’s feature drop</a> brings improved night photography in Snapchat, custom stickers, support for YouTube watch parties in Google Duo, as well as a new Live Caption feature you can use to communicate without even talking during phone calls. We go over these features in greater detail in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/7/22965199/google-pixel-update-features-phone-call-captions-battery-level-stickers\">our post about the update’s initial rollout</a>.</p><div id=\"Fy5AWL\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvXR--VSosE?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"CFCbCy\"><a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/153884074/google-pixel-update-march-2022\">The update</a> also brings a number of bug fixes, including “general improvements” for the fingerprint sensor’s stability and performance, as well as battery and thermal performance on the Pixel 6 phones. There’s also the promised fix for an issue causing Wi-Fi to randomly disconnect — a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923777/pixel-6-pro-february-update-wifi-bluetooth-bugs\">bug that was introduced in February’s update</a>. Google is also rolling out support for Verizon’s 5G C-Band on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, which will give users access to the ultra-wideband frequencies that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available\">the carrier lit up in January</a>.</p><p id=\"5qTdCV\">It’s not that surprising that Google decided to delay this update for the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, and I don’t blame the company for being extra careful. So far, Google’s track record with pushing updates to its flagship phones has been... a bit troubling. Last year, Google paused a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor\">highly anticipated December update</a> for Pixel 6 devices after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860191/pixel-6-pro-google-december-feature-update-paused\">users reported issues with dropped calls</a> and rolled out an amended version of the update that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884219/google-january-2022-pixel-6-pro-update\">went live in January</a>. And of course, there was the aforementioned February update that didn’t go over well for everyone either. </p><p id=\"AojUSo\">Here’s hoping that this update won’t screw up anything new this time.</p><p id=\"uXY4p0\"><em><strong>Update March 21st 4:00PM ET: </strong></em><em>Updated to add that the update is now available for Pixel 6 and 6 Pro devices.</em></p>",
