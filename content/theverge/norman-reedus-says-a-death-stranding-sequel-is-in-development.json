Now, however, it looks like we know after actor Norman Reedus let it slip in an interview that he’s working on a sequel to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima\"><em>Death Stranding</em></a>.</p><p id=\"1AX5rN\">Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.leoedit.com/culture/norman-reedus-on-the-end-of-an-era/\"><em>Leo </em>magazine</a>, Reedus said that “we just started the second one” when asked about his work on the first <em>Death Stranding</em>, before explaining just how much work went into his motion-captured performance. “It took me maybe two or three years to finish all the MoCap sessions and everything,” Reedus said. “It takes a lot of work. And then the game came out, and it just won all these awards, and it was a huge thing, so we just started part two of that.”</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"hTCRtt\"><q>“We just started the second one”</q></aside></div><p id=\"srwHIK\">While it’s not quite an official confirmation, it’s not exactly a surprise either. <em>Death Stranding</em> — which also starred Hollywood talent like Mads Mikkelsen and Léa Seydoux — was Kojima’s first release following <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/19/9572167/hideo-kojima-leaves-metal-gear-solid-publisher-konami\">his much-publicized departure from Konami</a>, where he directed the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> series. <em>Death Stranding</em> went on to become a hit that was eventually expanded through <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696322/death-stranding-directors-cut-ps5-kojima-3d-audio-dualsense\">a director’s cut</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21322476/death-stranding-pc-port-hide-kojima\">a PC port</a>.</p><p id=\"7KsP34\">It’s likely the actual release of the game is some ways away, but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/5/23058597/summer-game-fest-date-time-june-9-e3\">with Summer Game Fest happening next month</a>, an official announcement could happen very soon.</p>",
