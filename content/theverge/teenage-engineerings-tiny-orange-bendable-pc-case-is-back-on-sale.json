If you were really hoping to buy the $195 build-it-yourself mini-ITX case, you can <a href=\"https://teenage.engineering/store/computer-1/\">head over to the company’s website</a> and add it to your cart — though before you do, it’s probably worth refreshing yourself on the Computer-1’s... particularities.</p><p id=\"zmD4Or\">When Teenage Engineering announced this case, we had some concerns. It has barely any room for a modern graphics card (even this <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356900/asus-rtx-3060-phoenix-single-fan-compact-gpu-announced\">tiny RTX 3060</a> is bigger than Teenage Engineering recommends), the airflow situation seemed a little suspicious, and the “think twice, bend once” warning in assembly guide made the building process seem high-stakes. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KYrEKJpVeb28vtX8hVnfK7CW5KY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23354231/Screen_Shot_2022_03_29_at_17.17.59.png\">      <cite>Image: Teenage Engineering</cite>      <figcaption><em>Some assembly required.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"6JYhkX\">People who have since <a href=\"https://youtu.be/WOMeETfRQkE?t=383\">built systems in the case</a> say <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny6HFil5sos\">the bending</a> and the airflow aren’t huge problems, but they also discovered that the holes don’t come pre-tapped. That means that screwing into them might be a time-consuming forearm workout — not exactly the experience you’d expect with such an expensive piece of kit. (Quality Mini-ITX cases range from <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fblack-ssupd-meshlicious-mini-itx%2Fp%2F2AM-030R-00001%3FDescription%3Dmini-itx%2520case%26cm_re%3Dmini-itx_case-_-9SIAS0BDDZ3987-_-Product\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">under $100</a> to <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F2AM-000Z-00077%3FDescription%3Dmini-itx%2520case%26cm_re%3Dmini-itx_case-_-9SIAFSTEG39978-_-Product\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">around $200</a> — but those usually come pre-assembled).</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IIB2iwqQpObdd7piJf4A1M90a70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23354068/617a6916b20101000432bbd6_4096.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Teenage Engineering</cite>      <figcaption><em>On one hand: practicality.

And while there may be better ways to spend $200 on an orange flatpack PC frame — the Playdate that TE <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/22/18628360/playdate-panic-teenage-engineering-qwop-katamari\">designed with Panic</a> seems <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview\">pretty fun</a> and plenty stylish too — you don’t have many other options if you absolutely need a computer case that looks inspired by <a href=\"https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/HEV_Suit\">the Half-Life HEV suit</a>. Just be ready to spend a lot for something you have to bend and build yourself; beauty doesn’t come cheap.</p>",
