SpO2 sensors measure your <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22447-blood-oxygen-level\">blood oxygen saturation</a> — or, put more simply, the amount of oxygen you have in your blood. In fact, these sensors and metrics are included in most modern smartwatches and fitness trackers. The only issue is that not every wearables maker uses these sensors in the same way. </p><p id=\"gyv7OB\">Some smartwatches measure your SpO2 passively as you sleep while others will let you take a direct measurement. But don’t worry, we’ll get into what SpO2 sensors are, how they work, and their limitations. We’ll also dive into how to set up SpO2 measurements on some of the more popular wearables that support this metric.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"A person measuring SpO2 with both a fingertip pulse oximeter and the Withings ScanWatch.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UjCNyPyOid8OagMwpga-zdgKzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21900760/akrales_200916_4186_0105.0.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>A fingertip pulse oximeter is generally more accurate than the SpO2 sensors in your smartwatch.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"SS4LjH\">How SpO2 sensors work</h2><p id=\"TSLM12\">You might be familiar with pulse oximeters, which are <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/finger-pulse-oximeter#_noHeaderPrefixedContent\">clips you wear on your finger</a> that measure your blood oxygen saturation. These devices became more well-known during the early days of the pandemic, as low oxygen levels were <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/05/01/848400469/coronavirus-faqs-whats-a-pulse-oximeter-is-it-a-good-idea-to-buy-one\">a common symptom</a> for many people with COVID-19. This led to pulse oximeters becoming a must-have item.</p><p id=\"F4h2xe\">SpO2 sensors in smartwatches work similarly to the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors used to measure heart rate. PPG — or optical heart rate — sensors work by shining a green light into your skin to determine your heart rate based on the light that’s reflected back. The difference is that, instead of green light, smartwatch SpO2 sensors shine red and infrared light into your skin. Then, based on the way light reflects back, the devices use an algorithm to estimate your blood oxygen levels. </p><p id=\"c16rSI\">A “good” score is generally defined as anything above 95 percent, but results above 90 percent are also considered normal. Also, each wearable maker defines what a “good” or “normal” measurement is, so be sure to thoroughly read any included explainers. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"The sensor array on the bottom is different because of the new blood oxygen monitor\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xI5_E4QwRXtrfSzYb2Rls8Z3cQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21925620/vpavic_200929_4216_0119.jpg\">      <cite>Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The sensor array on the Series 6 includes red and infrared lights to measure SpO2.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"JAb1lc\">Limits of wearable SpO2 sensors</h2><p id=\"CX2UjN\">There are lots of reasons why wearable makers have begun adding these sensors to their devices. Most have added it as a factor in determining your sleep quality. Others, like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/30/16227040/fitbit-sleep-apnea-tracking-ionic-smartwatch-sensors\">Fitbit</a> and Withings, have added SpO2 sensors as a potential way to identify conditions like sleep apnea. </p><p id=\"n0hGuw\">But while fingertip pulse oximeters are a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/72470/download\">Class II medical device</a>, smartwatch SpO2 features are meant<strong> </strong>for general wellness only. As such, they generally <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21504023/apple-watch-ekg-blood-oxygen-fda-clearance\">do not require FDA clearance</a>. (The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price\">Withings ScanWatch</a>, however, has received <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722333/withings-fda-clearance-blood-oxygen-heart-rhythm\">FDA clearance for its SpO2 feature</a> to detect breathing disturbances during sleep.) Blood oxygen measurements taken from the wrist are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/23/apple-watch-oximeter/\">also usually</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232488/blood-oxygen-apps-iphone-samsung-unreliable-fitbit-garmin-oximeter\">less accurate</a> than those taken from the fingertip. That’s because while fingertip pulse oximeters shine light through your entire finger, wrist-based sensors use the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21438576/blood-oxygen-apple-watch-series-6-reliability\">less reliable method</a> of measuring the reflection of light. </p><p id=\"WzRziG\">In short, you should not use wearable SpO2 readings for any medical purpose whatsoever. You also shouldn’t put too much stock in these readings. The best they can do is give you a sense of what your baseline is. Even then, you should expect wonky readings from time to time.</p><p id=\"IqGN1k\">Now that we’re aware of the limitations, here’s how to use SpO2 settings and spot checks on various wearable platforms.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"The blood oxygen monitor’s light is quite bright, so much so you can turn it off when you’re in theater mode.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5umAGehCltexgZzGDXJNBjvoA2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21925637/vpavic_200930_4216_0230.jpg\">      <cite>Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>Here’s the SpO2 sensors in action on the Series 6.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"c53gMU\">Apple Watch</h2><p id=\"tV5j2q\">Apple introduced SpO2 sensors in its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7\">Series 6</a> Watch. That means if you want to take SpO2 readings, you’ll need either a Series 6 or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features\">Series 7</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features\">Apple Watch SE</a> does not include SpO2 sensors. </p><p id=\"kC0oMa\">On the Apple Watch, you can take 15-second spot checks of your blood oxygen levels. If you wear the device to sleep, it’ll also take background readings while you snooze. </p><p id=\"sJYlAk\">To set up Blood Oxygen on your Apple Watch:</p><ul><li id=\"CvPkf4\">Open the Health app on your iPhone.</li><li id=\"7Jok7v\">Tap the <strong>Browse</strong> tab.</li><li id=\"J0OqBk\">Scroll down to <strong>Respiratory</strong>.</li><li id=\"lryMot\">Tap <strong>Blood Oxygen</strong>.</li><li id=\"itTsVe\">Tap <strong>Enable</strong>.</li></ul><p id=\"MFhqEo\">To take spot readings:</p><ul><li id=\"Juyr1C\">Open the <strong>Blood Oxygen</strong> app on the Apple Watch.</li><li id=\"hRx6P0\">Tap <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li id=\"IALNGE\">Wait for 15 seconds.</li><li id=\"a5ADve\">Tap <strong>Done</strong>.</li></ul><p id=\"cztcov\">Keep in mind that spot check readings can be finicky. Try to keep very still while taking measurements, resting your arm on a table or your lap. Also, make sure your strap is comfortably snug and that the sensor array is making good contact with your skin. </p><p id=\"Vkykno\">To enable or disable background readings:</p><ul><li id=\"ekPkkz\">Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on the Apple Watch.</li><li id=\"p7hqTX\">Scroll down to <strong>Blood Oxygen</strong>.</li><li id=\"zTlR9I\">Toggle on or off <strong>Blood Oxygen Measurements</strong> for periodic daytime readings.</li><li id=\"sIsCdI\">Toggle on or off <strong>In Sleep Focus</strong> for nighttime readings.</li><li id=\"D8DGcG\">If you want to suppress readings during the movies or other events, you can toggle on or off the <strong>In Theater Mode</strong> setting.</li></ul>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Sensor array for the Fitbit Ionic\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXocGKpvVyrMqhsrpc2hXHm1ZG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9361147/vpavic_170925_2023_0026.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Ionic was the first Fitbit device to introduce SpO2 sensors in 2017.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"T80NFL\">Fitbit</h2><p id=\"cZ83Ys\">Fitbit was one of the first to incorporate SpO2 sensors in 2017 with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/2/16392612/fitbit-ionic-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-review\">Fitbit Ionic</a>.
