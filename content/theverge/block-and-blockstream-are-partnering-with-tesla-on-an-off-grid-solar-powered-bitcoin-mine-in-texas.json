Tesla’s 3.8-megawatt Solar PV array and its 12 megawatt-hour Megapack will power the facility, and construction has started on the project.</p><p id=\"XavAHR\">“Weʼre excited to start the construction of this facility using Tesla Solar and Megapack,” Adam Back, CEO and co-founder of Blockstream, said <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prweb.com%2Freleases%2F2022%2F04%2Fprweb18603738.htm&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F4%2F8%2F23016553%2Fblock-blockstream-tesla-solar-bitcoin-mine-texas\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in a press release</a>. “This is a step to proving our thesis that Bitcoin mining can fund zero-emission power infrastructure and build economic growth for the future.” </p><p id=\"uecZbd\">The goal is for the facility to be completed “later this year.” When it’s running, there will be a publicly available dashboard showing “real-time metrics of the projectʼs performance, including power output and Bitcoin mined.” The plan is for the dashboard to be available “24/7 from any browser, providing the industry with a real-world, real-time case study of a zero-emission energy Bitcoin mine.”</p><p id=\"7OJdb8\">“People like to debate about the different factors to do with Bitcoin mining,” Back said in <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/tesla-block-blockstream-to-mine-bitcoin-off-solar-power-in-texas.html?&amp;qsearchterm=tesla\">an interview with CNBC</a>. “We figured, let’s just prove it. Have an open dashboard so people can play along, maybe it can inform other players to participate.”</p><p id=\"GZYpt7\">Blockstream and Block (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812752/square-changing-name-block-jack-dorsey-cash-app-tidal-crypto-spiral\">formerly Square</a>) first announced <a href=\"https://blog.blockstream.com/en-blockstream-and-square-inc-join-forces-for-solar-powered-bitcoin-mining/\">in June</a> that they planned to build the facility.</p><p id=\"VTDDRR\"></p>",
