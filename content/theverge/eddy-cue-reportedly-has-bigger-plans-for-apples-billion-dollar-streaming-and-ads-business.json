In its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23046890/apple-q2-2022-earnings-iphone-mac\">most recent earnings report</a>, Apple said its services, which include the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple News, Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, and iCloud, added 825 million subscribers and earned <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY22_Q2_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf\">$19.8 billion in revenue</a>.</p><p id=\"YzTTiD\">As part of the shake-up, Cue has reportedly pulled Peter Stern, Apple’s current vice president of services, off of advertising to focus solely on its services division. Sources close to the situation told <em>Insider</em> that Todd Teresi, Apple’s vice president of advertising platforms, has absorbed Stern’s previous advertising duties and now reports directly to Cue after getting promoted at the beginning of this year. “The Services portfolio is too big now, with too many other growing segments,” a source told <em>Insider</em>. “The ad business is big enough to live on its own.”</p><aside id=\"X3Yr0e\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How Apple makes billions of dollars selling services  \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"T0OJgD\">Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data\">App Tracking Transparency policy</a>, which it implemented last year, could’ve been a factor in the growth of Apple’s ad business.
