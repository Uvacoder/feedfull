The Apple TV Plus film follows the struggles of Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), the only hearing member in a deaf family, as she tries to explore a life away from her family. Apple acquired the rides to <em>CODA</em> <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/spotlight/inside-the-record-breaking-deal-for-sundance-favorite-coda-1234898672/\">for $25 million</a> in a bidding war after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival last year.</p><p id=\"X375NS\">As well as winning Best Picture, <em>CODA</em>’s Troy Kotsur<em> </em>won Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film, and its writer-director Siân Heder also took away the award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Amazon was the first when it secured a Best Picture nomination for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/24/14371090/oscar-nominations-2017-amazon-vs-netfllix-best-picture-manchester-by-the-sea\"><em>Manchester by the Sea</em> in 2017</a>, although it lost out to <em>Moonlight</em> on the night itself. </p><p id=\"AWDCmS\">Netflix has also seen several of its films nominated for Best Picture, including <em>Roma</em>, <em>The Irishman, Marriage Story, Mank, The Trial of the Chicago 7, </em>as well as <em>Don’t Look Up </em>and <em>The Power of the Dog</em> this year. It picked up the most nominations for this year’s Academy Awards, 27 in total, but only won in the Best Director category for Jane Campion’s <em>The Power of the Dog</em>. </p><p id=\"EywJn6\"><a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/apple-best-picture-oscar-coda-1235213717/\">According to <em>Variety</em></a>, Apple reportedly spent over $10 million on its Oscars campaign for <em>CODA</em>, which is more than its entire production budget. CEO Tim Cook welcomed the news on Twitter, calling it a “profoundly beautiful movie” which “celebrates our differences.”</p>",
