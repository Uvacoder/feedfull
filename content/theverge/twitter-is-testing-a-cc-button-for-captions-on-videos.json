The company took some heat in 2020 when it was revealed that Twitter employees who wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers\">work on accessibility features volunteered</a> their time, but it’s since added a dedicated team focused on accessibility.</p><p id=\"ZcRg52\">Earlier this month, Twitter announced that its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/7/23015669/twitter-alt-badge-improved-image-descriptions-accessibility\">ALT badge and improved image descriptions</a> are now available globally, making alt text descriptions more prominent for all users. The company also confirmed it’s finally working on a long-requested functionality to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011327/twitter-edit-button-blue-test\">edit tweets</a>, which it’s rolling out first to its paying Twitter Blue subscribers. And reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong found evidence the service is testing a feature to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/22/23037174/twitter-vibe-status-update-feature\">allow users to set a status</a>, codenamed “vibe.” </p><p id=\"Hpo3C7\">It’s also testing an experiment where it will <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/22/23036956/twitter-toolbox-apps-promote-safety-block-mute-accounts-platform\">promote developers’ third-party safety tools</a> as part of its Twitter Toolbox. </p>",
