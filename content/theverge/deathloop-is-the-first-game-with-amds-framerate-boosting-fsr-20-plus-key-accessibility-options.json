AMD, Intel, and Nvidia are all out to prove that algorithms can trump native rendering performance. Why spend precious GPU cycles on native 4K when you can actually get a sharper, more detailed image by upscaling smaller pictures instead? </p><p id=\"VgA9bm\">It’s an argument <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784404/nvidia-icat-dlss-spatial-temporal-upscaling-graphics\">that’s never quite convinced me</a>, I’ll admit. But AMD’s new FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0, arriving for the first time today in an update for <em>Deathloop, </em>may have the potential to change that on PC.<em> </em>The new game patch also includes some key accessibility options — more on that later.</p><p id=\"RONpPB\"><em>PC Gamer</em> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-fsr-2-performance-first-impression/\">now says FSR 2.0 “really looks better than native 4K,”</a> and <em>Hardware Unboxed</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s25cnyTMHHM\">has a phenomenal video</a> showing off FSR 2.0’s performance in almost every type of shootout you’d want — including Nvidia’s DLSS, the original FSR 1.0, and native rendering each at 4K, 1440p and 1080p resolutions. </p><div id=\"eOhn2S\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s25cnyTMHHM?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"gXKUZL\">While I won’t truly be convinced till I have time to fire it up myself some evening, both journalists seem convinced that FSR 2.0 really does look better than native 4K in terms of detail, and <em>Hardware Unboxed</em> suggests it may give Nvidia’s DLSS a run for its money as well. Things get a little more even at 1440p and downright dicey at 1080p, but it clearly looks way way better than AMD’s FSR 1.0 (though that tech <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22982473/amd-radeon-steam-deck-features-super-resolution-fsr-2-0\">does have its uses</a>, too).</p><p id=\"xLaZ7E\">And for those who do agree it looks as good or better than native rendering, there’s a huge framerate boost waiting: enough to run <em>Deathloop</em> at 1440p with the highest settings, including raytracing, at over 60fps with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23064599/amd-radeon-rx-6950-6750-6650-xt-specs-price-gpu\">AMD’s humble new $400 RX 6650 XT</a>, says the company. But importantly, it doesn’t require an AMD graphics card: <em>Hardware Unboxed</em> tested on an Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti, for example, where they averaged over 60fps at 4K with FSR 2.0’s Quality mode.</p><p id=\"xo1Sf8\"><a href=\"https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/amd-fidelityfx-super-resolution-2-0-now-available-and-announcing/ba-p/524743?utm_source=pardot&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_campaign=2022-05-12-gaming-fsr2-available-en-email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term\">In a blog post</a>, AMD says 12 other games will add FSR 2.0 “in the coming months,” including: </p><ul><li id=\"La80no\">Asterigos</li><li id=\"02szFl\">Delysium</li><li id=\"nRBzU0\">Eve Online</li><li id=\"SrN1UQ\">Farming Simulator 22</li><li id=\"xF79AC\">Forspoken</li><li id=\"XQMAVD\">Grounded</li><li id=\"TdsEZY\">Microsoft Flight Simulator</li><li id=\"JDfdDw\">Nishuihan</li><li id=\"sJy1nK\">Overprime</li><li id=\"1R7xgF\">Perfect World Remake</li><li id=\"juRpAa\">Swordsman Remake</li><li id=\"7QHJok\">Unknown 9: Awakening</li></ul><p id=\"7gymOk\">At GDC 2022, AMD claimed it’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22993152/amd-fsr-2-0-xbox-nvidia-gpus\">a pretty easy tech to adapt to games, and may even come to Xbox</a>, but it does take some doing — if a game isn’t using Unreal Engine or temporal anti-aliasing, it might be four or more weeks of development work.</p><p id=\"JepxCp\">FSR 2.0 isn’t the only big update to <em>Deathloop. </em><a href=\"https://bethesda.net/en/article/136nbiVX0wu1gXY1HhaO8O/deathloop-game-update-3-full-patch-notes\">The new patch today</a> brings a dedicated photo mode, and a whole bunch of accessibility improvements, after the game <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/arkane-studios-deathloop-criticized-lack-accessibility-options/\">was criticized early for lacking them</a>. Arkane clearly took the feedback: among a whole list of intriguing toggles that let you do things like tagging multiple enemies at a time or enabling one-shot kills, you can now adjust the entire speed of the game, change combat difficulty, and choose how many respawns you want.</p><p id=\"nNXo9j\"></p>",
