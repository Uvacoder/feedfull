But after 3:45PM ET or so, every service again has a green light and says the problems have been resolved. Apple has not responded to a request for comment about what might have been going on.</p><p id=\"PWlvLI\">Reports of issues hit Downdetector shortly after 12PM ET, though reports look to have fallen in the hours since the outages were first reported. <em>The Verge </em>staff experienced scattered problems with iMessage and other key services, although the problems haven’t been impacting everyone equally. </p><p id=\"5Hr5E3\"><em>Bloomberg’s</em> Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1505954428762955781\">also reported</a> that Apple’s corporate and retail systems are down as well — which, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michael_billig/status/1505955228171993089\">according to this tweet</a>, appears to mean that some Apple Store employees have had to do their work on paper. </p><div id=\"Xo6o6Y\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Apple store systems are down and they’re literally doing everything on paper lol <a href=\"https://t.co/tdNpVPIepw\">pic.twitter.com/tdNpVPIepw</a></p>— Michael Billig (@michael_billig) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michael_billig/status/1505955228171993089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 21, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"OJPqum\">On the r/sysadmin subreddit, some reported that they couldn’t get into <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/tjggjt/global_apple_outage/\">Apple’s business manager portal</a>. A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wabetainfo/status/1505954886361436161?s=21\">tweet from WhatsAppBetaInfo</a> reveals that the problems even affected other apps (for example, trying to back up your chat history to iCloud).</p><p id=\"fCeD1i\">We’ve captured a few screenshots of the evolving list of services Apple says are affected in the gallery below:</p><div id=\"xbgmEC\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:11106938\"></div></div><p id=\"hrtDmN\">Apple’s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/system-status/\">status page for developers</a> was completely down at one point, though it is now showing a number of outages.
