The new show, which is set to be executive produced and directed by John Fawcett, will follow the lives of a new group of women who gradually begin to realize how deeply interconnected their origins are — despite the fact that none of them know one another. Given <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150804/orphan-black-series-finale-recap-retrospective-tatiana-maslany-bbc-america\">how the original <em>Orphan Black </em>came to a close</a>, it’s unclear whether <em>Echoes </em>will see Maslany return to reprise any of her core Clone Club roles or one of the dozens of other Leda clones that were still living out in the world by the series finale. Currently, <em>Orphan Black: Echoes </em>doesn’t have a firm release date, but AMC expects the series to premiere sometime in 2023.</p>",
