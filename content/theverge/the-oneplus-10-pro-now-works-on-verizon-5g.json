That 5G support includes C-band Ultra Wideband — that good mid-band 5G spectrum that’s coming online over the next few years — but not the super-fast millimeter wave (mmWave). <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22968066/apple-iphone-se-5g-mmwave-verizon-uw\">That’s no great loss</a>; mmWave is impressively fast but has a very short range and is likewise hard to find. Realistically, C-band strikes the right balance between speed and signal range, so it’s great to see it supported on the 10 Pro.</p><p id=\"mtuEKR\">The OnePlus 10 Pro’s availability in North America and Europe <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23003063/oneplus-10-pro-price-release-date-features\">was announced at the end of March</a>. At that time, OnePlus said it was working with Verizon on 5G certification, and though it wouldn’t confirm outright that the phone <em>would</em> be certified, it looked highly likely <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353052/oneplus-9-pro-verizon-5g-network-certified\">given how the situation unfolded last year</a>. </p><aside id=\"yOjzpl\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"OnePlus 10 Pro review: settling in\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23003212/oneplus-10-pro-review-screen-price-specs-battery\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"BuP283\">The news is less good if you’re on AT&amp;T. The 10 Pro now works on T-Mobile and Verizon 5G, but it’s not expected to get AT&amp;T 5G certification at all. If you’re on AT&amp;T and looking for a premium Android device, then your best bet would be sticking with Google or Samsung — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review\">the Pixel 6 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22955139/samsung-galaxy-s22-plus-review\">Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus</a> both work on its 5G network.</p>",
