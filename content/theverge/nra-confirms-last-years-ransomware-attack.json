Grief, which is said to be associated with <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/inside-evil-corp-a-100m-cybercrime-menace/\">well-known Russia-based hacking group Evil Corp</a>, threatened to release more documents if its payment threshold wasn’t met.</p><p id=\"czvq0x\">There’s no word on whether the NRA ever paid up. The organization never publicly confirmed the attack at the time, and instead <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NRA/status/1453453542170284042\">issued a statement on Twitter</a>, saying it “does not discuss matters relating to its physical or electronic security,” and that it “takes extraordinary measures to protect information.”</p><p id=\"myRra0\">The NRA didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment. It notes in the filing that it “has implemented additional cybersecurity measures to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence.” </p>",
