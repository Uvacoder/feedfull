They are, for the most part, a good thing. But as long-time Windows users know, occasionally, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326083/windows-10-security-update-bug-printer-crash-kyocera-ricoh-zebra-microsoft\">an update can go wrong</a>, and so some prefer to postpone updates for a week or two to make sure that there aren’t any problems being delivered with the update. In addition, sometimes updates come at an inconvenient time — for example, when you’re in the middle of a project with a tight deadline.</p><p id=\"XgeASN\">You <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq\">can’t stop updates</a> altogether, but you can pause them. There is also a way to disable updates, but it, too, is not permanent. If you want to hold off in case of any potential glitches or would rather put them off as long as possible, here is how to adjust your settings. </p><aside id=\"Cg402Z\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Looking for&amp;nbsp;how to&amp;nbsp;pause updates in Windows 10?

That way, you’ll know if a restart is coming, and if you want, you can reschedule the restart.</li><li id=\"bjNYYg\">Just below that, click on <strong>Active hours</strong>. Look for the drop-down menu at the right of <strong>Adjust active hours</strong> and select either <strong>Manually</strong> or <strong>Automatically</strong>. If you choose the former, you can select the hours during which it won’t restart (for example, if this is your work computer, you can choose not to have restarts between the hours of 9 a.m and 5 p.m.). If you choose the latter, the system will restart when you are not using it.</li></ul>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Advanced options lets you tweak your update settings.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vr3ECRy9F3Rgfx0xVLm1IQRYkI0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23393193/Screenshot__5_.png\">      <figcaption><em>Advanced options lets you tweak your update settings.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"UDFBfm\">Disable updates</h2><p id=\"bIpGWX\">If you want to stop updates from happening for longer than that, there is a way to disable updates that worked — somewhat — with Windows 10 and should also work with Windows 11. However, even using Windows 10, this was not permanent; most sites reported that eventually (especially with a reboot), updates did resume. This may give you some breathing space, however.</p><ul><li id=\"6sQWZa\">Use Win+R to open the <strong>Run</strong> box and type in <strong>services.msc</strong>.
