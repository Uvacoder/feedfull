Apple is not the one approving requests to add licenses or IDs to Wallet — instead, the company says Arizona will be responsible for that. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8raD22HRxnUqD9oc1GkWdubXL_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23339657/apple_id.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Apple</cite>  </figure><p id=\"DwDwiZ\">If you want to show your digital license or ID to TSA at the airport, here’s what the process looks like, according to Apple:</p><blockquote><p id=\"AgZxif\">On their iPhone or Apple Watch, users will be shown which information is requested by the TSA, and can consent to provide it with Face ID or Touch ID, without having to unlock their iPhone or show their ID card. All information is shared digitally, so users do not need to show or hand over their device to present their ID.</p></blockquote><p id=\"xuD4PQ\">According to Apple, during this process, “the TSA will also capture a picture of the traveler for verification purposes.” We’ve asked Apple and the TSA for details on where those photos might be stored, how they can ensure they stay private, and if the photos will be deleted after a certain period of time. We’ve also asked Apple and the TSA if these digital forms of ID will be Real ID compliant. You will need <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/25/21147550/real-id-explained\">a Real ID-compliant identification card</a> to fly domestically beginning in May 2023 (though that deadline has already been pushed <a href=\"https://ktvz.com/news/2021/04/27/real-id-deadline-pushed-back-again-this-time-until-may-2023/\">a couple of times</a>). </p><aside id=\"znwS1i\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Real IDs, explained\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/25/21147550/real-id-explained\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"LE4NzJ\">Apple has recently amped up its efforts to make the Wallet app a replacement for your physical wallet, though many of its initiatives have been only available sporadically. The digital licenses / IDs are right now only available “for use in select states at select TSA checkpoints within Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX),” <a href=\"https://learn.wallet.apple/id\">according to Apple’s fine print</a>. Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020\">digital car keys</a> are only supported by select BMW models, though they are reportedly coming to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/17/22887601/apple-digital-carkey-support-hyundai-and-genesis-cars-report\">Hyundai’s Genesis brand</a>. Digital hotel keys are available <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824367/apple-wallet-hyatt-hotel-key\">at certain Hyatt hotels</a>. And you can add a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212752\">COVID-19 vaccine card</a> to Wallet only if your healthcare provider or health authority supports the feature.</p><p id=\"M6Iulu\">Apple says additional states will offer the driver’s license and ID feature “soon,” including Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, the territory of Puerto Rico, and Utah. </p><p id=\"Q5cYCk\"> </p>",
