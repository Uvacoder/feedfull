I will forever be grateful to the amazing cast, crew and studio for their support, and for welcoming me into the <em>Fast</em> family.”</p><p id=\"Q9QJ73\">While Lin intoned that his departure from the film was amicable, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/04/justin-lin-fast-x-1235010537/\"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a> that the decision ultimately boiled down to creative differences that will now require Universal to find another director to helm the project. As it stands now, second unit footage is still being shot, but it’s likely that production on <em>Fast X </em>will momentarily stop until a new director is brought on who can get caught up to speed and replace Lin. Given the success of the <em>Fast </em>films, Universal’s got every reason to not want to slow down as we get closer and closer to <em>Fast X</em>’s previously announced May 19th, 2023, theatrical release date. But with Lin walking away, the studio’s going to have to make sure that whoever succeeds him has the vision to keep <em>Fast X </em>on track.</p><p id=\"nD8iC3\"></p>",
