But it is pretty clear he didn’t misspeak — <em>TechCrunch</em> has quote after quote from Mor insisting that Belkin has at least one product on the way.</p><p id=\"BR2EKg\">Either way, if Belkin hasn’t moved to the product concept phase yet, it seems unlikely that a product will come out for sure this year, especially in the middle of the pandemic when many companies are having a tough time shipping products around the world.</p><p id=\"nNwXll\">Belkin did seem excited about the potential for a Wi-Charge partnership in a press release this morning, though: </p><blockquote><p id=\"VHDShJ\">“In line with our continued commitment to deliver the best charging experience to our customers, we are excited to uncover the full potential of Wi-Charge’s unparalleled over-the-air wireless charging technology,” said Brian Van Harlingen, CTO, Belkin. “The future of charging has been transitioning from wired to wireless for years now and we anticipate over the air wireless charging to accelerate this evolution.”  </p></blockquote><p id=\"7ZGKCb\">If a Belkin product doesn’t materialize, it would be <em>far</em> from the first false start for truly wireless power transfer. We’ve been following the tech on and off for over a decade, watching companies <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14124938/energous-truly-wireless-charging-apple-ces-2017\">like Energous</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/3/14505460/ubeam-wireless-charging-first-public-demo\">uBeam</a> make promises and demos and go nowhere fast. More recently, Chinese phone makers, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/23/22296817/oppo-mid-air-wireless-charging-x-2021-concept-phone-xiaomi-motorola\">including Xiaomi, Oppo, and Motorola, have announced versions of the tech</a>, but none offered release dates last we checked. There’s no question that the tech works on a basic level; <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21044650/guru-wireless-charging-mmwave-cordless-over-the-air-radio-waves-ces-2020\">the demos are convincing</a>, but companies haven’t stuck the landing yet. </p><p id=\"DUygl3\">The previous “oh, we’re actually getting a real product” moment was also from Wi-Charge, when it announced the tech would appear <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21053980/wi-charge-alfred-locks-long-range-wireless-charging-smart-lock\">in the Alfred ML2 lock</a> at CES 2020. But we’re not seeing evidence that lock went on sale almost two years later, and the only mention of it on the company’s website is <a href=\"https://alfredinc.com/pages/hub\">buried in a hub page</a>. </p><p id=\"Z7KBni\">Wi-Charge’s tech also isn’t the kind that would charge a laptop or phone, by the way: it only beams 1 watt using infrared light, which is barely enough to charge a pair of wireless earbuds and their charging case. Still, it could keep low-energy devices continually powered, saving batteries, and it beams power up to 40 feet away, according to the company. </p>",
