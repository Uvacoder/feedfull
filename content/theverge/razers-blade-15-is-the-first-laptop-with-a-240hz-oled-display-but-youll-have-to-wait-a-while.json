It sports a 12th-gen Intel Core i9-12900H processor and an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22865535/nvidia-3080-ti-3070-ti-mobile-laptop-max-q-intel-amd-alder-lake-rembrandt\">Nvidia RTX 3070 Ti laptop graphics card</a> that should help you take full advantage of the device’s upgraded display. Razer says the Blade 15 will go on sale in the last quarter of 2022 for $3,499.99.</p><p id=\"yzfUdn\">The laptop’s 15.6-inch display, which covers the entire DCI-P3 color gamut, features a quick 1ms response that should allow for a lag-free gaming experience as well as 400 nits of brightness. It comes with 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB SSD, and one additional M.2 slot that you can use to further increase storage space. You’ll also find Thunderbolt 4, USB-C, USB-A, and HDMI ports on the sides of the laptop along with an SD card reader.</p><p id=\"vYWB3W\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512393/razer-blade-15-240hz-oled-4k-pro-laptop-gaming-specs-price-features\">Razer’s 2019 generation of the Blade 15 Advanced</a> laptop came with the option for a 4K OLED panel <em>or</em> a 240Hz LCD option. The new Blade 15’s display gives you the best of both worlds: a fast refresh rate and OLED panel (although it isn’t 4K).</p><p id=\"7CyQsZ\">As my colleague Cameron Faulkner points out, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855767/razer-2022-blade-gaming-laptops-14-15-17-specs-price-nvidia-intel-ddr5\">Razer doesn’t seem to be taking major risks with its 2022 lineup</a> of Blade laptops. Razer is opting to give its devices small spec boosts instead, in line with Intel and Nvidia’s incremental chip upgrades throughout the year. Razer released the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22946280/razer-blade-17-2022-review-specs-12th-gen-performance-nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-gaming-laptop\">new Blade 17</a> in February, which starts at $2,399.99 but goes all the way up to $4,299.99 for a 144Hz 4K display, Intel Core i9-12900H CPU, and GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. </p>",
