The pink, spherical creature helped earn Charlie Rosen and Jake Silverman a Grammy for the best arrangement, instrumental, or acapella for their take on <em>Meta Knight’s Revenge</em> from the 1996 classic <em>Kirby Superstar</em>. The cover was originally performed by the aptly-named 8-Bit Big Band, a 30 to 65-member orchestra that specializes in putting its own spin on video game music.</p><div id=\"OHYCXR\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-gTlQn8wec?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"V9kZbc\">In the past, the <a href=\"https://www.the8bitbigband.com/\">8-Bit Big Band</a> has performed <em>Zelda’s Lullaby</em> from the <em>Ocarina of Time, Fourside</em> from <em>Earthbound</em>, <em>Big Blue</em> from <em>F-Zero</em>, and much more. You can listen to the group’s performance of the reimagined <em>Meta Knight’s Revenge</em> in the embed above — it’s a real jazzy take on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdWckdX4LlE\">original track</a>, and dare I say, sounds even better than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwFgYVC4TWg\">Nintendo’s remake</a> included in <em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</p><p id=\"hLwoeC\">Video game music isn’t nominated for a Grammy very often, but this win is especially timely considering the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22991829/nintendo-switch-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review\">recent release of <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em></a>. In 2011, the song <em>Baba Yetu </em>from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/02/how-a-song-from-the-2005-civilization-iv-won-a-2011-grammy/\"><em>Civilization IV</em> won a Grammy</a> after getting re-released in a separate album. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2012/12/06/journey-earns-the-videogame-worlds-first-grammy-nomination/\"><em>Journey</em> was nominated for best score soundtrack</a> for visual media in 2012, but ended up <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2013-02-11-journey-soundtrack-loses-grammy-to-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo.html\">losing to <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em></a>.</p>",
