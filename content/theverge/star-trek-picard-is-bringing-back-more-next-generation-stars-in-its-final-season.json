Guinan’s return in season 2 has included both Whoopi Goldberg and a new performer, Ito Aghayere, assuming the role of young Guinan, as well as some timeline chicanery. So anything seems possible for William Riker, Beverly Crusher, Geordi La Forge, Deanna Troi, Worf, and Data.</p><p id=\"Ox4kfU\">The third season will be <em>Picard’s </em>last, and in a statement, showrunner and EP Terry Matalas says “it’s most fitting that the story of Jean-Luc Picard ends honoring the beginning, with his dearest and most loyal friends from the U.S.S. Enterprise.” Co-EP Christopher Monfette <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cwmonfette/status/1501077579557523461\">confirmed</a> the third season finished filming last month.</p><p id=\"eglPiS\">There’s no release date mentioned for the show’s third season, although season 2 is still airing, with new episodes arriving each Thursday and episode 6 poised to drop this week. Today’s announcement was timed to coincide with “First Contact Day,” celebrating the 2063 date in Star Trek lore marking when humans and Vulcans meet.</p>",
