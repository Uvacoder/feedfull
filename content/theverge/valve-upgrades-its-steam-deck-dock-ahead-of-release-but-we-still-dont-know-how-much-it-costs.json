The Steam Deck tech specs page originally said the dock would have one USB-A 3.1 port, two USB-A 2.0 ports, and an Ethernet port for networking, but the page now says that <em>all three</em> USB-A ports will use the much faster 3.1 standard, and it now specifies that the Ethernet port will actually be a Gigabit Ethernet port.</p><p id=\"quSlYZ\">According to the Wayback Machine, Valve’s Steam Deck tech specs page listed the original specs as of <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220212200007/https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech\">February 12th</a>, and the accompanying diagram of the dock pointed to an “Ethernet” port for networking. But <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220222215410/https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech\">by February 22nd</a>, the specs were updated to list the three USB-A 3.1 ports. And <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220225193441/https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech\">by February 25th</a> — the first day Valve began <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22902930/valve-steam-deck-release-date-gaming-handheld-pc\">selling the Steam Deck</a> — the dock diagram was updated to show the three USB-A 3.1 ports <em>and</em> a Gigabit Ethernet jack. </p><div id=\"M9Ow3x\"><div data-anthem-component=\"imageslider:11155359\"></div></div><p id=\"OT8IDf\">(The Wayback Machine’s February 25th archive is also the first time I see Valve using the header “Docking Station” instead of “Official Dock.”)</p><p id=\"bQ4L6r\">The upgrades seem like good ones for the dock and I’m looking forward to picking one up for myself. I’m envisioning a future where I can use the dock to play Steam games on the TV in my living room. Unfortunately, I don’t know exactly when I’ll be able to do that, as Valve has only provided a vague late spring 2022 release date for the dock, and the company hasn’t shared how much it might cost. Valve didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p id=\"Uv0nJ1\">If you don’t want to wait for Valve’s official dock, the company says you can use other USB-C hubs instead, like my colleague Sean Hollister did <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review\">in his review</a>. But I’ve waited <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping\">long enough</a> for the Deck itself, what’s another couple months for the dock?</p><div id=\"u7tOz6\"><div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Steam Deck review: glorious mess|106078\" data-volume-uuid=\"fef96bfb9\" data-volume-id=\"106078\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-236\" class=\"volume-video\" data-volume-player-choice=\"youtube\"></div></div>",
