According to the <a href=\"https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/press-releases/galaxy-a53-5g-and-galaxy-a33-5g-awesome-mobile-experiences-open-to-everyone/\">company’s press release</a>, the Galaxy A73 5G will be available in “select markets” from April 22nd, at a price that’s yet to be announced. </p><p id=\"W3h7g0\">Although the A73 also features a slightly bigger 6.7-inch display than the A53’s 6.5-inch panel, the big spec bump here appears to be its camera. At 108-megapixels, it’s one of the highest resolution phone cameras around. It outstrips the Galaxy A53, which <em>only</em> has a 64-megapixel main camera, and is the same as what Samsung has included on its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22941246/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review-price-screen-specs-stylus\">flagship Galaxy S22 Ultra</a>. High megapixel counts aren’t the be-all-and-end-all when it comes to phone cameras, but 108-megapixel sensors are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134366/samsung-108-megapixel-sensor-size-image-quality-noise-vs-iphone-xiaomi\">far from a gimmick</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MyVAVjC3gUpbR943f99lLalioM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23326494/galaxy_a73_5g_ma_1440x960_960x640.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Samsung</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Galaxy A73 5G.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"bqXTGf\">The 108-megapixel sensor is one of four cameras on the rear of the Galaxy A73, which also includes a 12-megapixel ultra-wide, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, and a 5-megapixel macro. It’s a shame that the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334392/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-a72-specs-price-camera\">A72’s 8-megapixel telephoto</a> hasn’t made the cut; it’s been ditched along with the A72’s 3.5mm headphone jack. Samsung’s product page for the Galaxy A73 5G doesn’t mention what processor it’s using (it’s listed simply as “Octa-Core (2.4GHz, 1.8GHz)”), but <a href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-a73-5g-launches-powerful-internals-108mp-camera/\"><em>SamMobile</em> reports</a> it’s a Snapdragon 778G.</p><p id=\"zM2rCs\">Other specs include a 5,000mAh battery with 25W fast charging (though there’s no charging brick in the box), a choice of 6GB or 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage, an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, and a microSD slot that’ll take cards with a capacity of up to 1TB. </p><p id=\"Gi5N2T\">Depending on its price, that could make the Galaxy A73 a very appealing prospect. But there’s currently no sign of it launching in the US, where Samsung is currently only committing to releasing its new Galaxy A53 5G.</p>",
