To check and see if you have it, open Google’s Android app, tap your profile picture, and look for the “Delete last 15 min” option. </p><p id=\"qgDb0R\">This feature has taken some time to make its way to the Android app. Google first announced the feature <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe/\">at Google I/O in May</a>, and it came to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578981/google-search-history-quick-delete-15-minutes\">Google’s iOS app in July</a>. At that time, Google said it would arrive on the Android version of the app later in 2021, but for some reason, the company missed that deadline. It’s unclear if Google plans to bring the feature to desktop — in its May announcement post, the company didn’t specify which platforms it would be available on, and in July, <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/new-privacy-tool-search/\">Google only said</a> that the feature was coming to the iOS and Android apps.</p><p id=\"Icjpfc\">Google also offers a tool to automatically delete things in your search history that are three, 18, or 36 months old. </p><p id=\"z9fyPz\"><em><strong>Update March 19th 8:30AM ET: </strong></em><em>Updated to add a statement from Google, and to reflect that the feature is currently rolling out on Android.</em></p><p id=\"R3DTCy\"></p>",
