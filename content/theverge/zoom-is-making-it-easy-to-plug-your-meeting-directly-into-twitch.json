There are a lot of use cases I can think of for this kind of thing, though — it’d be an easy option for people who want to do a live podcast, share a sermon, or make something like a town hall meeting publicly available. Or heck, just stream your 8AM stand-up if you’re really excited about sharing what you’re working on with the world (though you’d probably want to check company policy to make sure that’s okay).</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZASK6JHrKeTNjXLPEP9wD7mhuBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23340780/Screen_Shot_2022_03_23_at_14.06.55.png\">      <figcaption><em>The Live on Twitch button in Zoom is pretty user-friendly compared to the other ways to broadcast a meeting to the service.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"C05HkR\">To be clear, it’s not like it was impossible to stream a Zoom meeting to Twitch before. Zoom supports streaming to other platforms like Facebook and YouTube and would let you add a custom streaming service — so technically, you could’ve streamed to Twitch by adding your streaming URL and key. You could’ve also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21213548/live-stream-obs-how-to-streamlabsobs-windows-mac-hardware\">set up OBS</a> and used it to stream a meeting, but both of those options would’ve been more complex than the new process, which just involves clicking a “Live on Twitch” button and logging into the service. </p>",
