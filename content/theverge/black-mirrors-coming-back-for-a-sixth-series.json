It isn’t exactly surprising that Netflix is working on yet another installment of the tech-focused dystopian series, but it seems as if our next taste of <em>Black Mirror</em>’s going to be a little different than what we’ve seen before.</p><p id=\"oqrynW\"><a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/global/black-mirror-season-6-netflix-1235266891/\"><em>Variety</em> reports</a> that Netflix has greenlit <em>Black Mirror </em>and is currently in pre-production for its sixth series — the details for which are largely being kept quiet. Unlike the interactive <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch </em>and fifth series that came before it, <em>Black Mirror</em>’s anthological sixth series is reported to consist of more episodes and be more “cinematic in scope,” which is likely a sign of the show taking even bigger swings. There’s currently no word on when <em>Black Mirror’s </em>sixth season is set to begin production.</p>",
