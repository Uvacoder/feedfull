Frazzini has helped lead Amazon’s game division since 2009 and played a role in building the company’s game studio.</p><p id=\"J60CpN\">“Mike was there at the beginning of Amazon Games, and his leadership and perseverance helped build the games business from the ground up,” Amazon spokesperson Ryan Jones said in a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>. “Our recent successes with <em>New World</em> and <em>Lost Ark</em> are the result of the long-term, customer-focused vision for games he helped establish. We are very grateful for all his contributions, and wish Mike the very best.”</p><p id=\"Mmdi9K\">Amazon didn’t immediately reply to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"R4XBiO\"><q>Amazon Games has faced a number of issues under Frazzini’s leadership</q></aside></div><p id=\"zDVVuN\">Last year, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG\"><em>Bloomberg</em> released a report</a> detailing a number of issues within Amazon Games, including allegations that Frazzini, who began his career at Amazon running the books section of the marketplace, lacked experience with games and often rejected the advice of the developers he hired. The report also claims Frazzini would understaff projects and have developers “chase” the latest trends — projects that would ultimately become failures, like the <em>Fortnite</em>-inspired <em>Intensity</em> and <em>League of Legends</em>-like <em>Nova</em> that never made it out of development.</p><p id=\"2IEcSm\">These weren’t the only games Amazon faced challenges with, however. In 2018, Amazon Games <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17187836/amazon-game-studios-breakaway-status-canceled\">canceled its fantasy sports game <em>Breakaway</em></a><em>,</em> and in 2020, it <a href=\"https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/support/the-grand-tour-game/contact-us\">pulled <em>The Grand Tour</em></a>, a racing title based on a show of the same name, due to poor reception. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta\"><em>Crucible</em>, a free-to-play <em>Overwatch</em>-style shooter</a> was one of Amazon Games’ biggest letdowns — the studio canceled the game <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21246923/amazon-crucible-relentless-studio-free-to-play-launch-date-may-20\">after releasing</a> it and then <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308638/amazon-game-studios-crucible-closed-beta-failure-relentless-studio\">putting it back into a closed beta</a>. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265932/amazon-ceo-game-studios-andy-jassy-commitment-struggling-video-game-division\">Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote an email to staff members</a>, saying: “Though we haven’t consistently succeeded yet… I believe we will if we hang in there.”</p><p id=\"l3tyO2\">Amazon Games has seen success with <em>New World</em>, an MMORPG released last fall, but even this game wasn’t spared from a rough release; its launch date was <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-04-09-amazon-delays-launch-of-mmo-new-world-to-august-due-to-coronavirus\">pushed</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320325/amazon-new-world-delayed-spring-2021-crucible\">back</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285810/new-world-amazon-delay-august-2021-release-date\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609898/new-world-mmo-amazon-delayed-release-launch-date\">times</a> before it finally went live in September 2021. Its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/18/22937386/lost-ark-amazon-games-free-to-play-mmo-diablo-clone\">free-to-play <em>Lost Ark</em></a>, which was initially available only in South Korea, has also been well-received. <em>Lost Ark</em> became <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/12/22930757/lost-ark-steam-most-played-game-launch\">the second most played game on Steam</a> following its English localization, a sudden spike in players <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/21/22944611/lost-ark-mmo-long-queue-times-smilegate-amazon-games\">causing server issues and long queues</a>.</p>",
