As phones become more powerful and gain larger displays, laptops continue to get lighter. Tablet manufacturers haven’t been resting on their laurels, though. Many of the more recent tablets we’ve seen are looking to bridge the gap in terms of performance and, in select cases, handle some tasks more efficiently than both phones and laptops.</p><p id=\"9FlGBw\">The tablet spectrum is varied, too. Inexpensive models like the Amazon Fire HD 10 make for excellent media streaming devices, while those in Microsoft’s versatile Surface lineup can easily serve as ad-hoc laptops when paired with an optional folio-style keyboard. Then there’s the ubiquitous iPad, a slate that has become the go-to tablet for anyone searching for something in the Apple ecosystem (and for many outside of it).</p><p id=\"Ed0RyT\">Below, we’ve rounded up deals for a number of Android, iPadOS, and Windows tablets. We’ve also broken down the deals by manufacturer to make things easier, and we will continue to update this post regularly as new discounts and sales become available.</p><aside id=\"9eRJCi\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best iPad deals right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple\"},{\"title\":\"iOS 15.4 now live as Universal Control comes to iPads and Macs\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/14/22976606/ios-15-4-mask-compatible-face-id-emoji-tap-to-pay-airtags-stalking-update-release-date-features\"}]}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"smntxb\">Amazon tablet deals</h2><h3 id=\"g7ddx9\">Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids</h3><p id=\"PBGlPG\">Amazon’s tablet may not be the best choice for getting work done when you’re away from a laptop or desktop. But the kid-friendly model of the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Kids-Edition-tablet/dp/B07WDDT3G5?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fire HD 8</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Kids-Pro-tablet/dp/B08H5R1SH6?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HD 8 Pro</a>, with its ruggedized, kid-proof case, is perfect for media streaming and light app usage. Currently, neither tablet is available at a true discount. However, if you use the code <strong>2PACK8PRO </strong>at checkout when purchasing two or more of the HD 8 or 8 Pro, you’ll save 30 percent on your total. This lowers the cost of a pair of these tablets from $279.98 to $195.99. Just note that you can’t mix and match models here.</p><p id=\"v9umUT\">The key differences between the standard and Pro models of the HD 8 are a slimmer case for the Pro, in addition to a less restricted browser. Otherwise, the hardware is all the same.  </p><p id=\"61x8un\">The kids version of the Fire HD 8 uses the same 8-inch 1280 x 800 display, 2GB of RAM, and up to 12 hours of battery life. The storage is limited to just 32GB but can be expanded up to an additional 1TB with microSD card storage. Another fine selling point is the two-year, no-question-asked warranty, which will have Amazon send you a new tablet if your current one stops working for any reason.</p><p id=\"lV5zXE\">If you’re in the market for just one of these tablets, Amazon’s offer to save 20 percent on the purchase of a single Fire tablet <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b/?ie=UTF8&amp;node=10825011011\">with an eligible trade-in still stands</a>. As an added bonus, Amazon will also provide you with an Amazon gift card equal to the appraised value of your old device. Besides older model Fire tablets and Kindles, other devices eligible for trade include tablets from Apple, Samsung, and Microsoft. Even some select models of graphing calculators are accepted if you’re looking to really stretch your dollar.</p><div id=\"tAqV6K\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10648106\"></div></div><h2 id=\"B8waHm\">Apple tablet deals</h2><h3 id=\"4cfT1G\">2020 iPad Air</h3><p id=\"X8cK0e\">The recent announcement of a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22979828/apple-ipad-air-2022-review\">new iPad Air</a> has led Apple to significantly discount its last-gen predecessor, the 2020 iPad Air. The older model may lack Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip, but its A14 Bionic processor is still capable of delivering plenty of power and should be fast enough for the vast majority of apps. The tablet is also compatible with various iPad Air accessories, which allow you to transform it into an ad-hoc laptop using add-ons like Apple’s Magic Keyboard. The 10.9-inch tablet offers a terrific Retina display with 2360 x 1640 and a wide color gamut as well, not to mention a USB-C port for charging. Normally $599, the 64GB, Wi-Fi-equipped iPad Air is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J66ZMY7?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on sale at Amazon</a> in its green colorway for $529.99 and at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgPyrwaDmt7\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for $549.99. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a>  </p><div id=\"QLEPB2\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11132191\"></div></div><h3 id=\"qorU9B\">2021 iPad Mini</h3><p id=\"iwVFqp\">The latest model of the 64GB iPad Mini usually sells for $499.99 but can currently be found at both Amazon and Walmart for $459.99. This is matching the lowest price yet for the miniature Apple tablet. This model brings a number of welcome changes to the hardware, including removing the home button to make room for a larger display and adopting the USB-C charging standard instead of Apple’s proprietary Lightning connector. </p><p id=\"FFihkE\">The 8.3-inch display has a resolution of 2266 x 1488 and 500 nits of brightness with True Tone technology to fine-tune the display based on the lighting in your environment. The Mini features back- and front-facing 12MP cameras and can capture 4K video at 60FPS. All this is powered by Apple’s A15 Bionic CPU. Until Apple releases an iPad Mini with an M1 processor, which seems inevitable at this point, this Mini model is the one to beat.  </p><p id=\"1Vzqwq\">While it is compatible with the second-gen Apple Pencil, this version of the iPad Mini won’t work with Apple’s Smart Keyboard or Magic Keyboard Folio. It can, however, work with a number of third-party Bluetooth keyboards if you need a larger typing surface. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"CvTP1v\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10743705\"></div></div><h3 id=\"3tXUjV\">2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro</h3><p id=\"pzG4dH\">In many ways, the iPad Pro is the scaled-up model of the most recent iPad Air. The 12.9-inch Pro features Apple’s M1 chip, the same all-aluminum form factor, and the option for 5G connectivity. The 12-inch iPad Pro includes a larger Mini LED display, though, along with a superior camera array, support for Face ID, and a variable refresh rate. </p><p id=\"Hkh4eG\">The 128GB model with Wi-Fi normally costs $1099.99 but can currently be found at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932BKSLP/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgO4PR6t1uI\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for around $999. The current discount is appealing, but bear in mind that this particular model has maintained this price for several months, so we wouldn’t recommend paying more than $1,000 if you’re planning to pick one up. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"2QUxAs\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10474637\"></div></div><aside id=\"z5fxda\"><div data-anthem-component=\"actionbox\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"title\":\"Verge Deals on Twitter\",\"description\":\"Join our over 46,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals\",\"label\":\"Follow us!\",\"url\":\"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud\"}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"xGz0lF\">Lenovo tablet deals</h2><p id=\"rUIjBp\">This is a bit of an odd one here. The Lenovo Yoga Tab 13 departs from the typical design conventions used by other tablets, but these differences allow for some interesting applications that other tablets might struggle to replicate. I’ll tell you more about it below, but here’s the deal: normally the Yoga Tab 13 sells for $679.99, but it’s <a href=\"http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Yoga-Tab-13-13-0-Touch-60Hz-8GB-128GB-Android-11%2F986625159%3Fathbdg%3DL1700\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently discounted to $499.99 at Walmart</a>. It’s not quite the lowest price we’ve ever seen for this tablet but a solid discount nonetheless.</p><p id=\"MVoT2X\">In addition to being larger than the average tablet with a 13-inch screen, the most distinctive feature of the Yoga Tab 13 is the large adjustable handle that's attached to it. Besides providing a convenient way to hang this tablet on a variety of surfaces, this also allows the tablet to serve as an external monitor for any device that can be connected either via mini-HDMI or USB-C. The extended area that juts from the tablet also houses the large stereo speaker, lending it a much broader sound profile.</p><p id=\"LYsTvr\">The 13-inch touchscreen display has a resolution of 2160 x 1350 with a refresh rate of 60Hz and Dolby Vision for greater depth of color. While some of these features may give the Yoga Tab 13 the appearance of a laptop, it's still powered by the Android 11 OS, running on a Snapdragon 870 mobile CPU even though its 8GB of RAM makes it slightly more capable when running several apps in tandem. One important note regarding the specs is that it’s limited to 128GB of RAM, and without a microSD card slot, you’ll have to rely on external storage if you need additional space.</p><div id=\"I4m8gJ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11132040\"></div></div><h2 id=\"FbvGr0\">Microsoft tablet deals</h2><h3 id=\"taBmvp\">Microsoft Surface Pro 8</h3><p id=\"52oAbj\">If you don’t mind a limited port selection and are in need of a tablet that offers plenty of performance in a lightweight chassis, Microsoft’s high-powered Surface Pro 8 might fit the bill. The attractive, modern slate feature a 13-inch touchscreen, along with 2880 x 1920 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate — a rarity outside of the gaming sphere. It’s also a great teleconferencing device thanks to its far-field studio microphones and 5MP front-facing camera. Best of all, it serves as a competent stand-in laptop when using the integrated kickstand and the optional keyboard cover.</p><p id=\"eh5Vki\">Right now, the Surface Pro 8 is <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-8%2F8QWCRTQ8V8XG\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on sale at Microsoft for $947.99</a>, a cool $152 off the normal list price. Note that this particular model comes with an 11th Gen Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD. But it isn’t packaged with the Microsoft Surface keyboard. If you need a little extra built-in storage, <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-8%2F8QWCRTQ8V8XG\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the 512GB configuration is also discounted from its regular price of $1,399.99 to $1089.99</a>, although you can always expand the storage of this tablet with microSD cards. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"qiWfQ0\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10771697\"></div></div><h2 id=\"yzpSeE\">Samsung tablet deals</h2><h3 id=\"9WMufH\">Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 and S7 Plus</h3><p id=\"QIdVky\">The 11- and 12-inch models of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 still manage to hold their own, even with the recent release of the Tab S8 series. Both use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 Plus processor, can run on Android 12, feature quad-speaker systems, and come packaged with Samsung’s S Pen. The biggest differences between the two models are the displays. (The S7 uses an 11-inch LCD panel while the S7 Plus makes use of a 12.4-inch OLED display.)</p><p id=\"V2SrHM\">Although we’ve seen the standard 128GB S7 with Wi-Fi retail for as low as $450, it’s <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgQrGcYIUDK\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently only available on clearance at Best Buy for $552.99</a>, about $65 off its original retail price. The S7 Plus, meanwhile, is also on sale at Best Buy, where you can <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgPyV0Ga2Th\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pick up the 128GB, Wi-Fi-equipped model for $699.99 instead of $849.99</a>. We’ve seen steeper discounts on both models in the past; however, given the recent introduction of the S8 line, we don’t expect retailers — including Samsung — to offer either model much longer. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our S7 and S7 Plus reviews</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"qtL2xr\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10769388\"></div></div><div id=\"tf07dm\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11097080\"></div></div><h3 id=\"RelzUy\">Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 and A7 Lite</h3><p id=\"na79hy\">If you’re in the market for a barebones entertainment device — whether for yourself or your kids — the Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is a tablet to consider. The A7 Lite is currently <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Lite-Gray-32GB-SM-T220NZAAXAR/dp/B094Q89NKH?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available at Amazon for $119</a> instead of its typical $159.99. The tablet is a smaller and less powerful version of the standard A7. The 8.7-inch display offers just 1340 x 800 resolution, and, like the larger model, the base configuration comes with 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM. While less powerful, it’s also difficult to find a tablet with these specs that’s available at this price point.</p><div id=\"zGI8pw\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10869140\"></div></div><aside id=\"eZwGck\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
