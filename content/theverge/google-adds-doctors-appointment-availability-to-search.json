It will initially only be available in English.  </p><div class=\"c-float-right\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7T0aM9eSNaMpStWFHop7F8XZRkQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23339912/Search___CVS_Appointment_Availability.png\">      <cite>Google</cite>  </figure></div><p id=\"DY0wAd\">If someone searches for a doctor or a health provider’s office, they’ll see what types of appointments are available and the date of the earliest appointment. A “book” button will direct them to a third-party site to make an appointment. </p><p id=\"V99Cjm\">Searching for a San Francisco MinuteClinic, for example, will show an “appointments” tab with options for a TB test, vaccinations, skin condition, and other types of appointments. People can’t currently add advertisements to that section, DeJesse said. </p><p id=\"DqDpkx\">The tool’s debut comes after Google highlighted other health care search features <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22812570/google-search-doctors-medicare-language\">in December</a>, including the ability to see what languages are spoken in a doctor’s office and what insurance networks an office takes. </p>",
