I figured many would after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review\">reading critical reviews like mine</a>! And while I <em>have</em> seen a handful of people <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/\">in r/SteamDeck</a> reclaim their five bucks... almost every other sign suggests to me that it’s selling well.</p><p id=\"N6peC3\">While we don’t have official sales numbers for the Steam Deck, here is some context that might put things in perspective:</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"The Elden Ring banner art, depicting a knight below some glowing rings of fire.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDowA8rtDekAxYQbjq98QqFcRxw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23393384/elden_ring.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>Elden Ring is the context.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"mCdbyo\">The Steam Deck launched the same week as <em>Elden Ring</em>, currently one of the most popular games in the world. For four of the past five weeks, the Steam Deck was second only to <em>Elden Ring</em> in revenue according to SteamDB. But this past week, the Steam Deck <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/topsellers/2022W14/\">sold <em>better</em> than <em>Elden Ring</em></a>. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"9RwQ79\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Why the Steam Deck won’t&amp;nbsp;flop&amp;nbsp;like Valve’s Steam Machines\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial\"},{\"title\":\"Valve says it’s ‘ramping up’ Steam Deck shipments\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23010130/valve-steam-deck-shipments-order-emails\"}]}'></div></aside></div><p id=\"GcqfW7\">True, these are top grossing numbers, not unit sales numbers, so you can’t weigh them the same. At $60 each, it takes 7 copies of <em>Elden Ring</em> to match the amount of revenue a single $400 Steam Deck brings in; 11 copies if we’re talking a $650 512GB model. It’s also possible that <em>Elden Ring</em> saw the bulk of its sales pre-launch and during launch instead of in the weeks since — <em>Elden Ring</em> preorders did chart back <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/topsellers/2021W44/\">in November</a> and <a href=\"https://steamdb.info/topsellers/2022W02/\">January</a> as well. But I doubt the game’s truly trailed off given the incredible word-of-mouth that’s been following it since its February 24th debut. </p><p id=\"NVFZ8O\">Either way, we’re talking about a game that had already sold 12 million copies <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1504019697909616642\">as of March 16th</a>; where — at least in Europe — <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-03-15-elden-ring-is-the-biggest-new-ip-since-the-division-european-monthly-charts\">almost half of those sales were on PC</a>; and where “PC” effectively means Steam because it’s not on Epic or the Windows Store. So those #1 and #3 top grossing numbers for <em>Elden Ring</em> on Steam probably represent a <em>lot</em> of copies. </p><p id=\"jcu0YB\">If the Steam Deck, at #2, is selling even a sizeable fraction of <em>Elden Ring</em> while batting away everything else save <em>Lego Star Wars, </em>it’s going to be real hard to call the Deck a flop. </p><div id=\"Jl86aa\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SteamTopSellers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SteamTopSellers</a> for week ending 10 April 2022:<br><br>#1 - LEGO® Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga<br>#2 - Steam Deck<br>#3 - ELDEN RING<br>#4 - LEGO® Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga<br>#5 - LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga Deluxe Edition Preorder<a href=\"https://t.co/EdZPLogpMb\">https://t.co/EdZPLogpMb</a></p>— SteamDB (@SteamDB) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1513171457580445703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 10, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"UMEazo\">Valve’s Lawrence Yang said in February <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=231&amp;v=okANKhicgkc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">that the company would ramp up to produce “hundreds of thousands of units”</a> in its second month, and keep going from there. “If we’re doing this right, we’re going to be selling these in millions of units,” Valve president Gabe Newell <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/gabe-newell-expects-steam-deck-to-sell-millions-of-units-but-the-pricing-was-painful-to-pick/\">told <em>IGN</em></a> last July.</p><p id=\"KAWAGE\">Are we there yet? Valve hasn’t said, and probably won’t say, having mostly gone back to its traditional quiet mode since the Steam Deck’s launch. </p><p id=\"fc9cCl\">If crowdsourced data can be trusted, it sounds like the Steam Deck’s sales won’t be tailing off anytime soon, though. Yes, Valve’s <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck\">first-come, first-served reservations</a> are currently backed up to “October 2022 or later,” so anyone putting down $5 now probably won’t be counted as a buyer for many months. </p><p id=\"J9ZzW7\">But also, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/u3lygn/comment/i4q017e/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">the r/SteamDeck community has figured out</a> that Valve is still working through the first <em>fifteen minutes</em> of pre-orders from <em>the very first day</em> you could reserve one: July 16th, 2021. Some queues have been moving faster, but the US only just made it past <em>hour one</em>, and only with the 64GB model. </p><div id=\"sUSt6p\"><div class=\"reddit-embed\" data-embed-media=\"www.redditmedia.com\" data-embed-parent=\"false\" data-embed-live=\"true\" data-embed-uuid=\"5409cf40-bd0f-11ec-bc8c-9ee3a92eb387\" data-embed-created=\"2022-04-15T22:56:47.372083+00:00\"><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/u3lygn/order_email_megathread_04142022/i4q017e/\">Comment</a> from discussion <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/u3lygn/order_email_megathread_04142022/\">Fammy's comment from discussion \"Order Email Megathread (04/14/2022)\"</a>.</div><script async=\"\" src=\"https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js\"></script></div><p id=\"c7WziT\">In other words, Valve’s Steam Deck has been the #2 top grossing product on Steam for five weeks because of <em>a single day of preorder reservations</em>, and anybody who put down an order since then — heck, almost anyone who made their decision after taking the time to read a few reviews — haven’t yet been counted towards that gross. </p><p id=\"Y6U5XW\">I pre-ordered 1 hour and 35 minutes after launch because <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580453/valve-steam-deck-pre-order-handheld-pc-gaming\">Valve’s store was having issues</a>. Unless Valve is playing things fast and loose and counting “reserved” units as already sold, it might be weeks before my 64GB unit is counted toward the total.</p><p id=\"yw56mM\">Incidentally, Playtracker.net <a href=\"https://playtracker.net/insight/game/70772\">estimates that 994,000 Steam accounts</a>, give or take 10 percent, have put down a $5 deposit.</p><p id=\"Rnhc3I\">There’s another reason to think the Steam Deck isn’t a flop, though: people are loving it. I know I do, and my friends and colleagues who lucked out with preorders tell me they feel the same. </p><p id=\"w4hFtJ\">I know I said it was a mess, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w64KhTguWA\">because it was</a>, but Valve and developers have been cleaning up that mess week after week since launch, and it’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22960536/steam-deck-faq-valve-one-month-later\">getting better all the time</a>. I’m mostly playing <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Vampire Survivors</em> right now, but I haven’t had a crash in a while, and  games that didn’t work before are opening up — games I complained about like <a href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/back-4-blood-adds-experimental-support-for-linux-and-steam-deck/\"><em>Back 4 Blood</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/halo-the-master-chief-collection-broke-on-linux-and-steam-deck-heres-a-quick-fix/\"><em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/duck-game-gets-a-patch-for-proton-now-works-on-steam-deck/\"><em>Duck Game</em></a> are either fixed or in the process of getting fixed, even <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney\">if <em>Fortnite</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22957294/bungie-destiny-2-steam-deck-game-ban\"><em>Destiny 2’</em></a>s owners are refusing to bite. I played a bunch of <em>Duck Game</em> last night.</p><p id=\"vwPGaa\">I hear Amazon’s New World <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/u17gu9/steam_deck_gameplay_new_world_steam_os/\">might even be working now</a>, though I haven’t yet tried.</p><div id=\"xWR0wN\"><div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Steam Deck review: glorious mess|106078\" data-volume-uuid=\"fef96bfb9\" data-volume-id=\"106078\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-277\" class=\"volume-video\" data-volume-player-choice=\"youtube\"></div></div>",
