The company has been pitching its services far and wide, and although <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236075/elon-musk-chicago-boring-company-tunnel-politics\">many projects</a> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/boring-company-scrubbed-la-and-dc-tunnels-from-site-2021-4\">have run</a> <a href=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/san-antonio-mayor-does-not-see-the-need-for-a-boring-company-tunnel/\">aground</a>, authorities in Las Vegas last year approved the construction of a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22737228/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-loop-strip\">29-mile tunnel system containing 51 stations</a>. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d7RitPzdylL9hyVp1zpC-7aZx6Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23405790/las_vegas_loop_proposed_map.jpeg\">      <cite>Image: The Boring Company</cite>      <figcaption><em>The planned Las Vegas tunnel system, dubbed the Vegas Loop. </em></figcaption>  </figure></div><p id=\"8NXkaT\">The Boring Company describes its tunnels as a “public transportation system that resembles an underground highway” but — more succinctly and accurately — as “Teslas in tunnels.” Originally, Musk said the company’s tunnels would use autonomous <a href=\"https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/99333/elon-musk-s-boring-company-tests-124mph-tunnel-car-sled\">sleds to carry cars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/9/17102452/elon-musk-boring-company-pedestrian-cyclist-focus\">specially-designed pods</a> at speeds of up 150mph to transport pedestrians and cyclists. So far, they’re currently limited to electric vehicles (Teslas) driven by human employees at around 50mph and carrying ticketed passengers.</p><p id=\"pKhCe3\">The company’s Las Vegas tunnels have been open for a few years now, and first-hand impressions have been <a href=\"https://www.autoweek.com/news/technology/a38195296/a-ride-in-the-tesla-tunnel-under-las-vegas/\">mixed to say the least</a>. When everything goes to plan, the company’s tunnels let cars pass through them at sedate speeds. But when they’re busy they also create their own <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/ces-las-vegas-boring-tunnel-tesla-traffic\">traffic jams</a> — the very problem they’re intended to solve.</p><p id=\"t3crAB\">Investors, though, don’t necessarily care whether or not founders like Musk ultimately follow through on their hyperbole, only that the companies they run attract enough customers and revenue to pay back their own investments. And Musk has proved, time and time again, that’s he’s very good at pushing up share prices and valuations. For the meantime, that means The Boring Company has a lot of tunnels left to dig. </p>",
