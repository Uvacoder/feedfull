In a <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/03/15/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-588-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/\">new update</a> to Windows 11, a watermark has appeared on the desktop wallpaper for unsupported systems, alongside a similar warning in the landing page of the settings app.</p><p id=\"rK9RpN\">Microsoft had <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/22/22945407/microsoft-windows-11-unsupported-hardware-warning-desktop-watermark\">been testing these changes</a> last month, but they’re now rolling out to Release Preview just ahead of a full release to all Windows 11 users in the coming days. While Microsoft doesn’t mention the addition of a watermark in its <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/03/15/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-588-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/\">“improvements” list</a> for this update, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XenoPanther/status/1503809634053799936\">testers have noticed</a> it’s included.</p><div id=\"fNqBAO\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Confirmed: 22000.588 introduces the \"System requirements not met\" watermark.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WindowsInsider?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WindowsInsider</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RrizjV2g8i\">pic.twitter.com/RrizjV2g8i</a></p>— Xeno (@XenoPanther) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XenoPanther/status/1503809634053799936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"r5Vfxx\">If Windows 11 is running on unsupported hardware, a new desktop watermark will state “System requirements not met. Go to settings to learn more.” It’s similar, but far less prominent, to the semi-transparent watermark that appears in Windows if you haven’t activated the OS.</p><p id=\"KLiqoE\">It’s been possible to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22715331/how-to-install-windows-11-unsupported-cpu-intel-amd-registry-regedit\">bypass Microsoft’s minimum hardware requirements</a> for Windows 11 and install the operating system freely. The controversial hardware requirements mean Windows 11 only officially supports Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake or Zen+ and Zen 2 CPUs and up, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response\">leaving millions of PCs behind</a>. Anyone that has used the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22715331/how-to-install-windows-11-unsupported-cpu-intel-amd-registry-regedit\">workaround</a> will now start to see this warning in Windows 11.</p><p id=\"IUpHZt\">Microsoft has used similar warnings for unactivated versions of Windows in the past, and restricts features like dark mode, personalization settings, and themes from being modified until a system is activated. Microsoft doesn’t appear to be experimenting with any similar feature restrictions, and the desktop watermark can likely be disabled with some registry changes.</p>",
