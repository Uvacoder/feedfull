After all, there’s a reason the word “fit” is literally in their name: the unique buds permanently mold to the shape of your ear in 60 seconds during setup, which makes their ear tips some of the most comfortable we’ve ever tested. The Bluetooth earbuds also offer a host of other praiseworthy features, including good sound quality, a compact charging case, and lengthy, eight-hour battery life.</p><p id=\"1XMtCo\">If you don’t mind that they lack active noise cancellation and feature mediocre sweat resistance, they’re a great option to consider, especially now that they’re on sale for their lowest price to date. Now through 11:59PM PT / 2:59AM ET tonight, <a href=\"https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/c/482924/500013/8590?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcustom.ultimateears.com%2Fproducts%2Fue-fits&amp;sharedid=verge\">Ultimate Ears is selling the UE Fits for $149</a> in multiple colors when you use promo code <strong>BESTDEAL </strong>at checkout, a great deal considering they usually go for $249. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"jhprSj\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10881349\"></div></div><p id=\"4e8BY5\">The iRobot Roomba j7 is the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner\">best robot vacuum on the market</a>. Period. Not only does the well-designed vacuum clean well, but it’s also the first Roomba to come with AI obstacle avoidance, meaning it can use its camera to identify and avoid running into possible obstacles like socks and power cables. Plus, pet owners will be happy to know it can even detect and avoid running over feces. Other great features include room mapping with keep-out zones and the ability to link the vacuum with smart devices like your phone, so you can have it clean your house when you leave and stop when you return. For $200 more, you can also buy the iRobot Roomba j7 Plus, which comes with an auto-empty base. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22880352/irobot-roomba-j7-plus-samsung-jet-bot-ai-plus-robot-vacuum-review-comparison-test\"><strong>Read our iRobot Roomba j7 Plus review</strong></a>.</p><p id=\"Dbi0jP\">Unfortunately, all of those fancy features come at a cost: $599 for the iRobot Roomba j7 and $799 for the iRobot Roomba j7 Plus. These are no budget-friendly vacuums. Today, however, <em>Verge</em> readers can take advantage of free shipping and save $200 when they <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Firobot%2Droomba%2Dj7%2Drobot%2Dvacuum&amp;afftrack=VergeDeals041522\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">buy either the iRobot Roomba j7</a> or the <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Firobot%2Droomba%2Dj7%2Dself%2Demptying%2Drobot%2Dvacuum&amp;afftrack=VergeDeals041522\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">j7 Plus</a> from Wellbots using promo code <strong>VERGE200</strong>.

Regardless where you’re located, though, you can keep cool while keeping costs down with today’s deal on Ecobee’s SmartThermostat, which can automatically adjust the temperature of your home whether you’re home or not. The smart thermostat normally sells for $249.99 but is once again <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NQT85FC?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on sale at Amazon for its Black Friday price of $199</a>, which is just $7 shy of its all-time low. The price includes a magnetic mount and a wall mount as well as a stand so you can place the thermostat in a variety of areas. You can also buy it for the same price at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg2k4VPb7re\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecobee.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-thermostats%2Fsmart-wifi-thermostat-with-voice-control%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F4%2F15%2F23025200%2Fue-fits-earbuds-irobot-roomba-ecobee-smart-thermostat-logitech-webcam-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ecobee</a>.</p><p id=\"PUODVL\">As <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">we noted in our 2019 review</a>, the smart thermostat offers an easy-to-use touchscreen and is compatible with Apple HomeKit, Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, IFTTT, and SmartThings. It also includes voice support for both Alexa and Siri, meaning you can use the thermostat to play music, send an intercom message, and carry out a range of other tasks.</p><p id=\"5Y8MUN\">Other notable highlights include the thermostat’s support for flexible scheduling as well as an external temperature sensor that’s designed to help keep remote rooms comfortable. However, be mindful that Ecobee has a history of its servers going down, which means, in the past, it’s been challenging to actually remotely control the system.</p><div id=\"ngZmpu\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10789596\"></div></div><p id=\"eZ3cMz\">For those shopping for webcams, we consider Logitech’s C920S Pro HD to be the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best webcam for most people</a>, one that works with Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS. Like other webcams in its price range, it can record in 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second, but we found it stood out from others thanks to its out-of-box color balance, exposure, and fast autofocus. We also liked that it comes with extra perks, including a detachable privacy lens and a strong articulating stand, the latter of which you can perch on top of your monitor or screw into a tripod. </p><p id=\"mlTSjZ\">Regularly $69.99, <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeDeals041522&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Flogitech-c920s-pro-hd-webcam%2Fapd%2Faa542563%2Fpc-accessories\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dell</a> <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeDeals041522&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Flogitech-c920s-pro-hd-webcam%2Fapd%2Faa542563%2Fpc-accessories\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">and </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-C920S-Pro-HD-Webcam/dp/B07K986YLL?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> are offering this webcam for $59.99.
