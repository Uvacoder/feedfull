They cost $399.99, an increase from the prior 1000XM4s, and will go on sale May 20th. </p><p id=\"D5U1Td\">Sony says it has cranked up its already-fantastic noise cancellation to new highs by adding a second processor to the new headphones. The improvements are most noticeable in “mid- to high-frequency noise,” according to the company’s press release. That includes things like everyday city street noise and human voices. </p><p id=\"NUH8Oq\">The 1000XM5s have a design that’s quite different from their recent predecessors. Sony has gone for a sleeker look, switching to a stem-style slider and moving the microphones (there are now <em>eight</em> of them) around the perimeter of the ear cups. The 1000XM5s also use a new type of synthetic leather on the headband, which is a bit thinner than on prior models. Controls haven’t changed: you still control audio with tap and swipe gestures, and there’s a physical button for switching between ANC and ambient modes.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txNBH-Emv3-R9sA4IlycM8ZlS4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23455712/WH1000XM5___12_.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Sony</cite>      <figcaption><em>The WH-1000XM5s have an all-new design.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"0wg1gG\">The internal components have also changed. Sony has ditched the 40-millimeter drivers of the 1000XM4s in favor of new 30-millimeter drivers that supposedly sound more natural and “improve sound clarity and bass reproduction.” One of the criticisms of the 1000XM4s was their at-times muddy bass, so it seems Sony has worked to address that with the new model.</p><h3 id=\"vDE6Ic\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/22831686\">Sony WH-1000XM5 review: new design, new sound, new price</a></h3>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zccitc4Sl2iL-1b-6xb0JBZQY_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23455849/WH1000XM5___3_.JPG\">      <cite>Image: Sony</cite>      <figcaption><em>They come in black or off-white.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"knG2do\">Sony is also highlighting improved voice call quality made possible by four beamforming mics and AI noise reduction algorithms. All the signature Sony features — LDAC, DSEE Extreme upscaling, 360 Reality Audio, Speak to Chat, and so on — have made their way to the 1000XM5s. </p><p id=\"agEYU7\">These headphones don’t really do anything <em>new</em> compared to the WH-1000XM4s, which Sony plans to continue selling. But the company seems confident that they surpass past 1000X-series headphones at the most important things like sound quality, noise cancellation, and voice calls.</p><p id=\"1c63k9\">Is that true?
