The original Connect plans included a $15 per month offering for unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of data and a $25 per month option that bumped up data to 5GB a month. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"LXel9r\"><q>More data for T-Mobile’s prepaid plans</q></aside></div><p id=\"VlKbTo\">Those tiers are still available today, although the company is bumping up the total data included by 1GB each (for 3GB per month on the $15 plan and 6GB per month on the $25 one), in addition to adding the new $10 offering.</p><p id=\"ljQsrZ\">Also new is a $35 per month plan, which (similar to the $15 and $25 tiers) offers unlimited talk and text but has 12GB of data. All four plans don’t include tax in their cost, which is something to consider, but do include access to T-Mobile’s 5G network, too.</p><p id=\"LEHlqi\">The new Connect plans will be available from T-Mobile on Friday, March 25th. </p>",
