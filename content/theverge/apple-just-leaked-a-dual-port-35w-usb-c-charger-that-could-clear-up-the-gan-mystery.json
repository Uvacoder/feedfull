It puts out a measly 30W of power to a single device, yet Apple charges $50 for it. Please <em>do not buy one</em> because we now have firm evidence that Apple is about to replace it with something much, much better — a 35W charger with <em>two</em> ports, likely powered by gallium nitride (GaN) technology that might also make it smaller. </p><p id=\"ttv5Qa\"><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/04/08/apple-support-doc-reveals-unreleased-dual-usb-c-35w-power-adapter-releasing-soon/\">That’s the word from <em>9to5Mac</em></a>, which got this particular scrap of information from by far the most reliable source of Apple leaks: Apple’s own website. Apparently, the company accidentally threw a support document live for an “Apple 35W Dual USB-C Port Power Adapter,” and 9to5 managed to snap a screenshot before it was pulled. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeCuM7_4HrKHifgZAsEPcSZXkbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23376806/apple_35w_dual_port_power_9to5_mac.jpg\">      <cite>Screenshot by <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2022/04/08/apple-support-doc-reveals-unreleased-dual-usb-c-35w-power-adapter-releasing-soon/\" target=\"_blank\">9to5Mac</a></cite>      <figcaption><em>9to5Mac screenshotted an official support document confirming the name “Dual USB-C Port 35W Power Adapter”</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"mK5l2o\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22966880/apple-30w-gan-charger-ming-chi-kuo\">This is likely the “about 30W” GaN charger</a> that analyst Ming-Chi Kuo tweeted about last month, which he said would have “a new form factor design” and arrive in 2022.</p><p id=\"lkSXr5\">You could fast charge an iPhone 13 Pro Max and an Apple Watch at the same time with that level of power, or an M1 MacBook Air and a watch, or an iPad and an Apple Watch, or a pair of iPhones, or an iPad Pro and an iPhone at a slower rate, or... it’s USB-C, so there are a lot of possibilities.</p><p id=\"nHX4ox\">It wouldn’t be Apple’s first GaN charger — that would be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734233/apple-140w-macbook-charging-brick-gan-usb-c-pd-3-1-third-party-chargers\">the 140W power adapter</a> it shipped with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro. But unless I’m mistaken, it would be the first dual-port charger Apple has ever made and certainly the first with USB-C. </p><p id=\"rlDl4E\">In fact, there’s a dual-USB-C-shaped hole seemingly waiting for it in the Apple Store. Apple carries Belkin chargers that <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPYV2ZM/A/belkin-boost%E2%86%91charge-pro-usb-c-wall-charger-20w-with-cable?\">have a single USB-C port</a> and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPYU2ZM/A/belkin-boost%E2%86%91charge-pro-usb-c-wall-charger-32w\">a 32W charger with both USB-C and USB-A ports</a>, but not <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Charger-Delivery-Enabled-Charging/dp/B09GH6ZFB4?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Belkin’s dual-USB-C charger</a> — and that’s Apple’s premier accessories partner we’re talking about. You can obviously find quite a few dual-port USB-C chargers outside of the Apple Store, though, including many with higher speeds. </p><p id=\"Yy5BXW\">Note that this device would offer 35W total, not 35W per port. <em>9to5Mac </em>says the support doc states each port can operate in one of the following four modes: either 5VDC/3A, 9VDC/3A, 15VDC/2.33A, or 20VDC/1.75A. That should easily allow two devices to charge at 15W or one at 27W and one at 5W, but we’ll have to see which combinations of devices might work. </p><p id=\"cwC1Mt\">The support document doesn’t suggest <em>when</em> the charger might arrive but does say that a USB-C cable will not be included.</p>",
