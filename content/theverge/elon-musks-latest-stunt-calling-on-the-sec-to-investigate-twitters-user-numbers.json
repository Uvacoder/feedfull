This morning, the company’s prospective new owner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526465624326782976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1526465624326782976%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F5%2F17%2F23085296%2Felon-musk-bots-twitter-20-percent-deal-acquisition\">insisted</a> (in a tweet, of course) that the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23028323/elon-musk-twitter-offer-buyout-hostile-takeover-ownership\">$44 billion deal</a> he’d agreed to “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/17/23085296/elon-musk-bots-twitter-20-percent-deal-acquisition\">cannot move forward</a>” until he sees the proof he’s looking for about its active user numbers. </p><p id=\"9LFl1x\">With <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/16/23075363/parag-agrawal-elon-musk-twitter-bot-report-acquisition\">needling current Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal</a> and texting former CEO Jack Dorsey having failed to hit the spot, Musk — seemingly jokingly — pulled in another recurring character from his 24 / 7 revolving circus by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526602003362750466\">tweeting</a> to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, asking them to investigate.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4KzzEdNPFi37ttfjWekRmHClqeo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23518377/elon.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Twitter</cite>  </figure><p id=\"E5csca\">In case you’ve forgotten, the folks at the SEC are the “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23025511/elon-musk-sec-funding-secured-tesla-twitter-ted\">bastards</a>” that Musk has previously accused of infringing upon his rights to free speech, although that’s not the only thing he’s called them in the past.</p><div id=\"6jXk4f\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon’s</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1278764736876773383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 2, 2020</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"3BLiE0\">His quarrel with them has focused on their attempts to enforce <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/27/23044743/elon-musk-tesla-sec-lawsuit-loss-consent-decree-twitter\">a consent decree he agreed to in 2018 over the “funding secured” tweets about taking Tesla private</a>. Of course, you could add to that the investigations into Musk and his brother over <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949453/tesla-elon-musk-kimbal-sec-investigation-insider-trading\">possible insider trading</a> and even his failure to make a timely disclosure about how much Twitter stock he’d acquired before making a bid for the company.</p><p id=\"bYALjV\">Joke or not, Twitter has had troubles with accurate metrics and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23046170/twitter-miscounted-daily-users-three-years-q1-2022-earnings\">recently admitted</a> it had been overcounting daily users for years. Twitter’s CEO stands by the estimates about the amount of bot activity included in its daily active user (DAU) metric; however, now that puts Parag Agrawal in a standoff that Musk <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/13/23070422/musk-twitter-buyout-acquisition-analysts-stock-drop\">might be using to lower his price for the company or exit the deal altogether</a>.</p>",
