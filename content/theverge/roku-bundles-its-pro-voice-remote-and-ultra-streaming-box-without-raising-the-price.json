Despite the fact that Roku is including a remote that <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.roku.com/products/accessories/roku-voice-remote-pro\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">costs $30 to purchase on its own</a>, the Ultra will stay at <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459599/roku-ultra-2020-announced-features-dolby-vision-wifi\">its original $99.99 price point</a>.</p><p id=\"2WEc2O\">In its press release, the company says that the bundling will begin in “mid-May,” and its website already says that the Ultra comes with the Pro remote. When my colleague Chris Welch <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22391174/roku-voice-remote-pro-review-features-price\">reviewed the remote last year</a>, he liked that he had the option of giving voice commands to his Roku without having to press a button. And while he admired the fact that it no longer required AAs, it was a bit of a bummer that the remote charged via Micro USB.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"wa3xZv\"><q>There isn’t a pro price premium</q></aside></div><p id=\"pLjdju\">This isn’t the first time Roku’s bundled in the remote with one of its streaming boxes. The $70 Streaming Stick 4K Plus <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22679935/roku-streaming-stick-4k-plus-price-specs\">also includes it</a>. That model, however, comes at a $20 premium over the regular Streaming Stick 4K. It’s nice to see that Roku is just including it with the Ultra without a price bump. That makes the streaming box, which features HDR and an ethernet port, a pretty decent deal — even more so when it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/6/10/22526716/roku-ultra-amazon-apple-watch-6-razer-pc-gaming-airpods-deal-sale\">inevitably goes on sale</a>.</p>",
