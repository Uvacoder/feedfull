But the thing with thrones is that the crown often weighs heavy — being MVP and getting play of the game <em>every round</em> can be tiring. Thankfully, <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/you-dont-even-have-to-sit-up-under-your-own-power-with-1848757174\"><em>Gizmodo</em> found</a> just the thing to help with that: a motorized gaming bed that moves you from the sleeping position to the pwning position with the press of a button, all the while keeping your gaming setup within arms’ reach. </p><p id=\"l8GI63\">The <a href=\"https://www.bauhutte.jp/product/bgb100fa/\">Bauhutte Electric Gaming Bed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bauhutte-g.com/product/bhd1200bd/\">Bed Desk</a> are made to work in tandem: your rig goes on the adjustable desk, which is designed to have a bed placed under it, and the bed frame uses motors to elevate your back and knees into a seated position (though, admittedly, not a very ergonomic one). After your gaming session, you can use a remote stored on the side of your bed to lower yourself back into a sleeping position, so you can curl up and rest your weary eyes. It can also raise or lower the head and feet sections separately, giving you a few configurable sleeping and sitting positions. </p><div id=\"qLg6fb\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/43N3KGF9Lcc?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"ozoQKJ\">There’s also a fleet of accessories. Bauhutte’s website suggests pairing your gaming bed with <a href=\"https://www.bauhutte-g.com/product/bhs430ew/\">an “energy wagon”</a> that stores gamer fuel, a <a href=\"https://www.bauhutte-g.com/product/bht830/\">combo clothing rack, table, and storage unit</a> (for your gaming peripherals, of course), or even <a href=\"https://www.bauhutte-g.com/product/hfd-4g/\">a “ninja onesie 4G”</a> that makes sure you’re as stealthy IRL as you are in the game. Bauhutte isn’t just selling you a bed / gaming chair — it’s selling you a lifestyle. It’s worth noting that the company seems to have been building up to this point: there was a <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/this-is-an-excellent-gaming-bed-1842020532\">non-motorized version</a> of the gaming bed setup in 2020, and in 2021 we <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/a-mattress-designed-for-gamers-goes-on-sale-in-japan-1847757874\">heard about its gaming mattress</a>. Now, it’s all come together into motorized bliss.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UMeL5y_CqO_nv0vdU3GsUoYuBl8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23377502/top_03.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Bauhutte</cite>      <figcaption><em>Sleeping in the ninja onesie 4G, surrounded by your Bauhutte products.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"5s8vaj\">While I don’t imagine that this product is terribly comfortable as either a bed or a chair, I don’t think it’s entirely fair to write it off completely. For someone who lives in an extremely small space like a single bedroom or studio apartment, this could actually be a decent way to fit both a bed and desk into a confined area. It could also be useful to people with limited mobility; some mechanical assistance getting out of bed could be an extraordinary help.</p><p id=\"hS9DaI\"><em>Gizmodo</em> reports that the bed frame costs around $480 (or 59,800 yen) by itself, and one Amazon seller has it listed for around $680 (84,709 yen) <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/Bauhutte-%E3%83%90%E3%82%A6%E3%83%92%E3%83%A5%E3%83%83%E3%83%86-%E9%9B%BB%E5%8B%95%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%99%E3%83%83%E3%83%89-BGB-100FA-BK-2%E3%83%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E5%BC%8F/dp/B09W5DWBJ9?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&amp;crid=2PGE2YOH6TJCS&amp;keywords=BGB-100FA&amp;qid=1648086358&amp;sprefix=bgb-100fa%2Caps%2C175&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bauchair-22&amp;linkId=2c8cb5ed131dbf19b6a17c610e80108e&amp;language=ja_JP&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;th=1\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">with a gaming mattress</a>. The frame is roughly 78 inches long, and 37 inches wide, which should let it hold a <a href=\"https://www.americanmattress.com/pages/mattress-size-chart\">US twin-size mattress</a>. Unfortunately, it seems like Bauhutte is <a href=\"https://www.bauhutte.jp/product/bgb100fa/\">mainly focused</a> on selling the bed in its home country of Japan, and the solo frame is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/Bauhutte-%E3%83%90%E3%82%A6%E3%83%92%E3%83%A5%E3%83%83%E3%83%86-%E9%9B%BB%E5%8B%95%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%99%E3%83%83%E3%83%89-BGB-100FA-BK-2%E3%83%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E5%BC%8F/dp/B09TVCLDRK?__mk_ja_JP=%E3%82%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A&amp;crid=2PGE2YOH6TJCS&amp;keywords=BGB-100FA&amp;qid=1648086358&amp;sprefix=bgb-100fa%2Caps%2C175&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bauchair-22&amp;linkId=2c8cb5ed131dbf19b6a17c610e80108e&amp;language=ja_JP&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;th=1\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sold out on Amazon Japan</a>. </p><p id=\"KL9kDC\">Thankfully, there are <a href=\"https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-adjustable-bed-bases.html\">plenty of other motorized bed frames out there</a> — though it’s hard to say if it would feel the same without the associated desk and gamer branding. </p><aside id=\"zJn42Y\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"I tried the pixel-flavored Coke, and it Bytes\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23014905/coke-byte-pixel-flavored-soda-review-fortnite-metaverse\"}]}'></div></aside>",
