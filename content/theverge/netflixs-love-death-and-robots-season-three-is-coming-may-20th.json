The company announced <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHXaMVQq4cc\">the release on Monday with a short video</a> — though don’t be fooled by the footage of <em>The Crown</em> and <em>The Queen’s Gambit</em> at the beginning. The streaming service teased that a third volume was on the way when it announced Volume 2 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22392424/netflix-love-death-robots-season-two-trailer-dog-poop\">almost exactly one year ago</a>, but only gave a vague “2022” release at the time. </p><p id=\"z8YbJ2\">In the video, Netflix didn’t specify how many episodes would be included with the new season. Volume 1 had 18 episodes, while Volume 2 had eight, and according to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/love-death-and-robots-returns-in-volume-2-trailer-already-renewed-for-volume-3\">a report from <em>IGN</em> last year</a>, there will be eight episodes in the third volume as well. We’ve reached out to Netflix to see if that’s still the case.</p><p id=\"7dwhhb\"></p>",
