Last July, publisher Annapurna Interactive said <em>Stray</em> would be released <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22597945/annapurna-showcase-stray-artful-escape-solar-ash-outer-wilds\">in early 2022</a> on PS5, PS4, and Steam, but it seems now we’re going to have to wait just a little bit longer to play the game.</p><p id=\"hciBsm\">What does one do in a cyberpunk cat simulator, you might ask? “<em>Stray</em> is a third-person cat adventure game set amidst the detailed neon-lit alleys of a decaying cybercity and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly,” developer BlueTwelve Studio says <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_campaign=072921&amp;utm_medium=directreach\">on the game’s Steam page</a>. “Roam surroundings high and low, defend against unforeseen threats and solve the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by nothing but unassuming droids and dangerous creatures.” You’ll also befriend a drone known as B-12 that can help you interact with objects and communicate with the inhabitants of the city.</p><p id=\"hV4KaA\">If you want to get an idea of what the game looks like in action, check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R-splyERsI\">this gameplay walkthrough from July</a>. Yes, you will be able to scratch a couch. </p><div id=\"UlUGWL\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8R-splyERsI?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div>",
