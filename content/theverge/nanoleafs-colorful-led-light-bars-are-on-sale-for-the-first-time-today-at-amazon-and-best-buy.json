At $200, however, they’re also some of the more expensive. Luckily, you can now get these stunning lights as a part of a starter set for a little less. Regularly $199.99, Nanoleaf’s new Lines Smarter Kit — which includes an adapter and nine Lines you can affix to your wall to display colorful lights in a variety of patterns — is on sale for $179.99 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LWVWN8M/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgVQGorNwp5\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>.</p><p id=\"GfSLgi\">Unlike Nanoleaf’s other lighting fixtures, these LED light bars are backlit, making them perfect for sticking behind a gaming monitor or TV. There’s also a music visualizer that uses a built-in microphone to pick up on ambient noise and pulse the lights in time with your music, as well as a screen mirroring feature that allows the lights to mimic the colors actively being displayed on your monitor or TV screen. The Nanoleaf companion app additionally offers 19 pre-loaded scenes, so you can create a sunset-like effect or add that thumping nightclub vibe to your room you’ve been pining for since the pandemic started.</p><p id=\"lSmiDK\">On the compatibility front, the Lines offer support for Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, and Google Assistant, so you can play these scenes either by touching a button in the app or issuing a voice command. They even support Thread, meaning they’ll be able to integrate with the new Matter standard when it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22982166/matter-smart-home-standard-postponed-fall-2022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launches in the fall</a>. Note, however, that these lights can’t physically connect with other Nanoleaf panels, just in case you own others and want to link them. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22758017/nanoleaf-lines-review-smart-light-bars\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"UA3qWj\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11121159\"></div></div><p id=\"9CGOBl\">The Amazfit Bip S is the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22985108/best-fitness-tracker\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best affordable fitness tracker</a> on the market, one that is far cheaper than your average Fitbit or Apple Watch. It’s an even better buy today, now that <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAmazfit-Bip-S-Fitness-Smartwatch-40-Day-Battery-Life-10-Sports-Modes-Heart-Rate-1-28-Always-On-Display-Water-Resistant-Built-in-GPS-Carbon-Black%2F713618229&amp;subid1=TheVergeDailyDealsMarch312022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart is selling the black model for $49 ($21 off)</a>, the lowest price we’ve seen the wearable sell for this year.</p><p id=\"FugLiQ\">The Amazfit Bip S may not be as attractive as other trackers on the market, but like some of its more expensive rivals, it delivers accurate results, offers built-in GPS, and features a colorful always-on display. You won’t need to worry about it running out of battery life, either, as the fitness track offers two weeks of battery life, as well as other useful features, like continuous heart rate monitoring and advanced sleep tracking. While it’s less of a smartwatch and more of a fitness tracker, it’s compatible with both iOS and Android, allowing you to view notifications, control music playback, and edit watch faces.</p><div id=\"tVKtjc\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11121106\"></div></div><aside id=\"QfB3Xd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals\"}]}'></div></aside>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NFaMtklC-gfA3Yh0F-u2_O2vedM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22444764/vpavic_untitled_20210411_0151.jpg\">      <cite>Image:  Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>Photo taken using DJI Mavic’s Air 2S drone.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"EspQqY\">If you’re looking to step into the world of aerial photography or upgrade your existing setup, you can save hundreds right now on a DJI Mavic Air 2S bundle at B&amp;H Photo. Normally $2,498, you can buy a kit containing the drone, a DJI RC Pro controller, and accessories at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1676542-REG%2Fdji_cp_ma_00000369_02_air_2s_fly_more.html%2Foverview&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F3%2F31%2F23003046%2Fnanoleaf-lines-amazfit-bip-s-dji-mavic-air-2s-drone-8bitdo-xbox-remote-jbl-flip-5-speaker-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fdjidjia2scrc.html&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup033122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adorama</a> for $1,749 — the bundle’s lowest price to date. The new controller offers a 5.5-inch, 1080p display boasting up to 1,000 nits of peak brightness, along with the same control sticks found on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22308345/dji-fpv-review-first-person-drone-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FJI FPV drone</a>. In addition to the controller, the bundle also includes three batteries, a gimbal protector, a shoulder bag, a pair of control sticks, and a handful of other accessories. </p><p id=\"YRgVcz\">In <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22384692/dji-mavic-air-2s-drone-2021-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">our review</a>, we called the compact Mavic Air 2S a fantastic drone for beginners and experts alike. It’s compact, much like the DJI Mini 2, but more capable thanks to its larger image sensor and improved zoom capabilities. The drone offers a one-inch, 20-megapixel camera sensor, which is the same size as the one found in the larger, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17826384/dji-mavic-2-pro-zoom-drone-review-specs-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">higher-end Mavic 2 Pro</a>. It’s also capable of recording 5.4K videos and 4K up to 60fps.</p><p id=\"XX0iMi\">However, some of these upgrades come with downsides. DJI rates the battery at 31 minutes of flight time, which is slightly less than the Mavic Air 2’s, and you can’t digitally zoom in while shooting in some modes or while taking photos. There’s also some significant cropping that occurs when you record in 4K at 60fps.</p><div id=\"m95jEk\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11121042\"></div></div><p id=\"X9lKiC\">If you’d like a media remote for your Xbox console, 8BitDo’s larger Media Remote is an affordable choice that’s compatible with both the Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S. Unlike the Short Edition, the Long Edition comes with a number pad as well as some extra buttons for features like closed captioning. Both remotes also come with backlighting and Xbox buttons to easily navigate menus and apps, as well as a Home button so you can immediately wake up your Xbox. As an infrared remote, you also don’t need to worry about pairing or setting it up, allowing you to immediately use it with your Xbox console. You do need to make sure the Xbox is within the remote’s line of sight, however; otherwise, it won’t work. </p><p id=\"T3JVZV\">Normally $24.99, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2R2GRM/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon is currently selling the Long Edition for $21.10</a> — a modest yet rare discount. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722115/8bitdo-xbox-media-remote-review-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"YPuvjf\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11121510\"></div></div><aside id=\"CxmPGu\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are some must-have accessories for your new Xbox Series X or Series S\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21550830/xbox-series-x-s-wireless-controller-ssd-hard-drive-accessories\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"DUb4Uu\">Summer is slowly yet steadily approaching.

That’s a $30 discount and the lowest price we’ve seen this year on the portable Bluetooth speaker, which offers robust sound for its size, full IPX7 waterproofing, and can be paired with JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers for stereo sound.
