That’s because Sonos makes speakers that — more often than not — boast great sound quality, support for all the major streaming platforms, and simple multi-room functionality. Unfortunately, however, all of those perks often come at a high price. Sonos products aren’t cheap, and, outside of the occasional rogue discount, they rarely go on sale. However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to save at least a few dollars on Sonos gear.</p><p id=\"0n3fqh\">If you’re comfortable buying refurbished, for example, you could save a decent amount. We also occasionally see sales on Sonos’ collaborative series with Ikea and discounted bundles that include Sonos products, which makes it easier to set up an entire home audio system while saving money. And, if you’re a student, Sonos offers <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsRoundup/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/unidays\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a program you can join</a> to get a 15 percent discount when you spend up to $2,500 on full-priced speakers and accessories.</p><p id=\"oasRfQ\">Regardless of their existence, these discounts can be hard to find. That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best Sonos deals you can currently take advantage of. Here, we’ll guide you through the best sales available right now to help you get the best bang for your buck.</p><aside id=\"uc7Uka\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Exclusive: this is the new budget soundbar from Sonos\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/21/23035569/sonos-new-soundbar-2022-s36-fury-specs-price-release-date\"},{\"title\":\"Exclusive: Sonos is about to introduce its own voice assistant\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/4/23056149/sonos-voice-assistant-features-release-date\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"tADqVf\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:11107320\"></div><div id=\"vOOFaf\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:11107219\"></div></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YUF7DM578A-oUxb7g0FvYE74ifo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422275/SonosShower.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The portable Roam offers the best water resistance of any speaker in the Sonos lineup.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"LaMDDC\">Sonos Roam deals</h2><p id=\"0TwudD\">The Sonos Roam is one of the clearest, most pleasant portable speakers we’ve ever used, and we’d recommend it as a personal speaker for small gatherings. It offers a rugged design, a relatively durable build, wireless charging, and support for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. It’s also compatible with Apple’s AirPlay 2, which lets you stream music from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac over your home network. Plus, it’s the first Sonos speaker with an IP67 dust and water resistance rating, which means you could use it in the bathroom or near pools. </p><p id=\"ZPSpjx\">Note, however, Sonos won’t let you pair two in stereo when listening over Bluetooth, unlike other similar speakers, though you can play Bluetooth audio over your entire Sonos system. It also only offers around 10 hours of battery life, which isn’t that great, and it can be challenging to use the speaker’s Wi-Fi features outside of your home. </p><p id=\"nTWozG\">Nevertheless, it’s a good portable speaker you can currently <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgPZSQc8Lv4\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">buy in refurbished condition at Best Buy in white for $154.99</a> ($25 off) and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgPZOprPFgi\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">black for $159.99</a> ($20 off). If you can make do without the microphones, <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11556673?sid=TheVergeBestSonosDealsMarch252022&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Froam-sl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sonos has also recently started selling the Roam SL for $159</a>, which is $20 cheaper than the Roam currently retails for. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our Sonos Roam review.</strong></a> </p><div id=\"f3VTq2\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11077060\"></div></div><aside id=\"w6oyWf\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Sonos’ Roam SL drops the mics\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22956293/sonos-roam-sl-chip-shortage-portable-bluetooth-speaker\"},{\"title\":\"Sonos might make your next TV streaming OS\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991456/sonos-home-theater-os-tv-rumor-job-listings\"}]}'></div></aside>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tHdH5YzTp0B-ulP0tPsRbA6AMJQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23335200/Screen_Shot_2022_03_21_at_2.12.53_PM.png\">      <cite>Sonos</cite>      <figcaption><em>The newer Sonos Five sounds exactly like its fantastic predecessor, the Play:5.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"jnjodX\">Sonos Five (2020) deals</h2><p id=\"UiJWZK\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248545/sonos-five-speaker-announced-play-5-price-features-release-date\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sonos Five</a> replaced the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9412233/sonos-new-speaker-play-5-trueplay-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Play:5</a> music speaker in 2020 but is actually nearly identical to its excellent-sounding predecessor. It shares the same six custom-designed drivers inside, so it should offer the same high-quality listening experience as the Play:5, which was ideal for large rooms or parties. Other than that, however, there aren’t many noticeable differences. Compared to the Play:5, Sonos says its successor offers increased memory and processing power, as well as a new wireless radio. There are also all-black or all-white options. Note, however, that the Sonos Five lacks a built-in microphone and support for Alexa and Google Assistant — something every other speaker in the current Sonos lineup offers.</p><p id=\"PHxadb\">The Sonos Five starts at $549, and there are currently no discounts to speak of. If you want a pair, however, you can buy a new set of two for $1,049 instead of $1,098 from <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11556673?sid=TheVergeBestSonosDealsMarch212022&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Ftwo-room-pro-five\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sonos</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1565702-REG%2Fsonos_five_wireless_speaker_pair.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22979801%2Fsonos-deals-speakers-soundbars-subwoofers-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>.

We praised how well it improves TV sound quality in our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2018 review</a>, as well as how simple and easy it is to set up and use. It’s not as great as other standalone speakers in the Sonos lineup for just playing music, but as a general-purpose speaker, it’s a good buy overall, especially if you’re adding it to an existing Sonos setup. The entry-level Sonos Beam also offers touch controls and support for Apple’s AirPlay 2, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant, allowing for hands-free voice controls. And while it lacks the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">second-gen Beam’s support for Dolby Atmos and an eARC HDMI port</a>, it remains a competent soundbar.</p><p id=\"Fic18T\">Right now, you can <a href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-11556673?sid=TheVergeBestSonosDealsMarch152022&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fbeam-b-stock-shadow\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">buy a refurbished, first-gen Sonos Boam from Sonos for $319 instead of $399</a>, which is the price it retails for when sold new. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"nLXTLF\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9603369\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DZs-EUcyyLPDGCcKjRrENclkrp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9480615/cwelch_171017_2068_0002.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The small Sonos One supports a range of music services and comes with a good microphone.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"346wuO\">Sonos One (second-gen) deals</h2><p id=\"XVb4QA\">The Sonos One is a small smart speaker with a good microphone for voice control. It emits balanced, full-bodied sound that’s impressive for its size while integrating well with existing Sonos products. The 2017 speaker also works with a range of music services and supports both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, however, the process for setting up voice assistants can be complicated. The One offers touch controls, too, as well as support for AirPlay 2 thanks to a post-launch software update.</p><p id=\"dwXpZt\">The Sonos One typically retails for $219, and while there are currently no deals available on the standalone speaker to speak of, you can buy a two-room set for $419 instead of $438 from <a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-11556673?sid=TheVergeBestSonosDealsMarch212022&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2F2-room-music-system-one-white\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sonos</a>, <a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsoonewg22.html&amp;subid1=VergeSonosDeals040722\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adorama</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1467468-REG%2Fsonos_one_pair_kit_black.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F22979801%2Fsonos-deals-speakers-soundbars-subwoofers-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/18/16490866/sonos-one-speaker-review-alexa\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"N6gjqU\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10523576\"></div></div><aside id=\"S8iWGm\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Sonos raises prices for majority of products amid supply chain crunch\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667044/sonos-speaker-price-increases-announce-september-12\"}]}'></div></aside>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ic_ObSCz6SBTUL2-DGpoj6o9f4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888939/cwelch_290921_4780_5681.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Sonos Immersive Set comes with the second-gen Sonos Beam, which supports Dolby Atmos and HDMI eARC.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"det913\">Sonos Immersive Set with Beam deals</h2><p id=\"HDldTU\">The Sonos Immersive Set has everything you need for a surround sound setup.
