According to <em>9to5Google</em>, <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/04/20/google-messages-bug-camera-background-drain-battery-fix/\">a recent bug in Google’s Messages app</a> on Android phones left the camera running in the background — a great way to both heat up your phone and run down your battery. </p><p id=\"JwyeoR\">The Google Messages app allows you to easily take a photo directly from the app and attach it to a chat message. According to the article in <em>9to5Google</em>, the camera app would occasionally keep running, even when you did not have it on screen. (This issue <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/stem75/camera_running_constantly_in_backgroundthrough/\">was also reported happening</a> with a Pixel 6 Pro in a Reddit group.)</p><div><div class=\"c-image-grid\"><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Using the camera to send an image via Messages (see lower-left corner) might keep the camera running.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6XWK1a7lcAgvXxA6B-30d7kIJo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23407381/Screenshot_20220421_162055.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>Using the camera to send an image via Messages (see lower-left corner) might keep the camera running.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"You can, if you want, deny Messages permission to use the camera.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ynSmrd8Ob6_91Op7mmzjkn0LFK4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23407380/Screenshot_20220421_162631.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>You can, if you want, deny Messages permission to use the camera.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div></div></div><p id=\"sBpIaQ\">We were not able to reproduce the issue. However, if you do find that your phone is unusually hot or the battery is running down especially quickly, it may not hurt to make sure your camera isn’t still running — or to simply swipe the Messages app off the Recents view, which will close the app down. You can also deny Messages permission to use your camera altogether by going to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Messages &gt; Permissions &gt; Camera and selecting “Don’t allow.”</p><p id=\"EOBfMq\">However, that may not be necessary. According to Scott Westover, communications manager at Google, the bug has been identified and the fix is currently rolling out to users. </p><p id=\"z7mc6S\"></p><p id=\"Vmbxis\"></p>",
