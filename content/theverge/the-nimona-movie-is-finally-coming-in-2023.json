She’s a fighter…but she’s also got some really awesome people fighting for her. I am excited out of my mind to announce that THE NIMONA MOVIE IS ALIVE…coming at you in 2023 from Annapurna and Netflix   <a href=\"https://t.co/wEZuM2sXTt\">pic.twitter.com/wEZuM2sXTt</a></p>— ND Stevenson (@Gingerhazing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gingerhazing/status/1513517319841935363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"CZvrdX\">Netflix’s <em>Nimona </em>tells the story of how shapeshifting teen Nimona (Chloë Grace Moretz) becomes the one person who can save the life of a knight named Blackheart (Riz Ahmed) after he’s falsely accused of committing a crime. Back when it was still under Blue Sky Studios, <em>Nimona </em>was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/disney-nimona-movie-lgbtq-characters\">poised to become Disney’s first</a> animated movie featuring multiple <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/10/22967765/disney-dont-say-gay-bill-chapek-florida-hrc\">queer lead characters and a same-sex kiss</a>. Though this would have made <em>Nimona </em>a historic Disney production, the studio reportedly pressured animators to remove the kiss from internal presentations about the project, potentially endangering its chances of making it into the final cut.</p><p id=\"eLRCDT\">Considering Stevenson’s track record with Netflix, it’s likely this version of the movie’s going to be much more in line with the source material’s take on its characters’ relationships and <em>Nimona</em>’s ideas about the mutability of identity, which is probably going to make it a far better story.</p>",
