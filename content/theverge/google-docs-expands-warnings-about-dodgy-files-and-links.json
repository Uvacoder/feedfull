This banner already appears when dodgy files are accessed <a href=\"https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/01/warning-banners-in-google-drive-alert.html\">from within Drive</a>, as well as from suspicious links within <em>separate</em> Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings files.

However, the company tells us this was a typo, and that it should instead say that the banner appears on “links <em>from</em> Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings” files. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"c1CWgD\"><q>Scammers have used Google files to get malicious links in front of users</q></aside></div><p id=\"svqhLQ\">The warning banners appear to be an attempt to combat scams that use Google’s office productivity software to create a veneer of authenticity around dodgy links and phishing attempts. In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-drive-spam-comments-phishing#:~:text=Hacking-,A%20new%20scam%20uses%20Google%20Drive%20to,a%20deluge%20of%20dodgy%20links&amp;text=Scammers%20just%20found%20a%20new,land%20people%20on%20malicious%20websites.\"><em>Wired</em> reported</a> on a wave of scams that were using Google’s various sharing and collaboration features to get their malicious files in front of unsuspecting users. Clicking a link in one of these documents sends a user to a site filled with dodgy ads, or a typical phishing site asking them to enter bank or other account details. </p><p id=\"g4s3Xd\">Google’s announcement says that the new warning banner is rolling out over the next couple of weeks to all accounts, business and personal alike. </p><p id=\"lM37qt\"></p>",
