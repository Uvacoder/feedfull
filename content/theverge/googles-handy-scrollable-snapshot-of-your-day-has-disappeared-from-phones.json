It was a small but useful feature — unfortunately, though, it was also not easy to find unless you knew where to look. As a result, it’s probable that not many Android users actually knew about it.</p><p id=\"UDP1jZ\">So it was almost inevitable that Google would eventually announce that Snapshot was going to be sunsetted — which it did when it began running notices within the app back in March. And now <em>9to5Google</em> is reporting that the feature seems to have disappeared completely from Android phones. (Certainly, it’s not on my Pixel 6 phone running Android 12, although it was still available on my original Pixel running Android 10.)</p><div><div class=\"c-image-grid\"><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Can you find the tiny inbox icon that will access Snapshot?

It created <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3569684/google-now-android-4-2-knowledge-graph-neural-networks\">Google Now back in 2012</a> to act as a comprehensive digital personal assistant; that app was slowly phased out over the years in favor of the much more interactive (and verbal) Google Assistant, and its collections of visual info were (sort of) replaced by Snapshot. </p><p id=\"9y4LtS\">You can now count Snapshot as one with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning\">all the other Google apps</a> that have gone to their graves. If you are a Snapshot fan and want to get the information that used to be available, Google has <a href=\"https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/11135696\">published a support page</a> with the various places you can find that data. Or you can simply say “Hey, Google, what do I have scheduled for today?”</p>",
