In the show’s latest trailer, King Viserys Targaryen, Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, and Prince Daemon Targaryen want nothing more than to further ensure that their family’s control over Wesreros’ other power players remains intact. </p><p id=\"qJySDM\">But the Targaryen family’s infighting — to say nothing of the inbreeding — creates the perfect opportunity for their conniving rivals from Houses Stark, Velaryon, and Lannister<strong> </strong>to make plays for the Iron Throne and destroy the true source of the ruling family might: their magical winged beasts.</p><p id=\"h3b8P0\"><em>House of the Dragon </em>hits HBO Max on August 21st.</p>",
