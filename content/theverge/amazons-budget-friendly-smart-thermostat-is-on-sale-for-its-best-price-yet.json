And they’re also a great buy for bargain hunters given that they can lower your monthly energy bill.</p><p id=\"VpcBqj\">In honor of the holiday today, some retailers are discounting an array of smart thermostats, including Amazon’s budget-friendly option. Right now, you can buy the Smart Thermostat for $47.99 instead of $59.99 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg5abEHopsF\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kohls.com%2Fproduct%2Fprd-5557989%2Famazon-smart-thermostat-works-with-alexa.jsp&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F4%2F22%2F23035493%2Famazon-smart-thermostat-apple-mac-mini-anker-google-nest-ipad-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kohl’s</a>, which is its lowest price to date. Plus, depending on where you live, you may be eligible for a rebate of up to $50 from your local energy provider.</p><p id=\"F6Obua\">Despite its relatively low price, Amazon’s Smart Thermostat is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22791333/amazon-smart-thermostat-review-learning-geofencing-hunches\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one of the best our reviewer has ever tested</a>. Like more expensive thermostats, it can learn and adapt to your habits. It also comes with a faceplate and dons a good-looking, minimalist design that doesn’t look cheap as well as enough controls for easy, regular use. However, its budget-based price does mean it lacks some features. The thermostat can’t integrate with voice assistants beyond Alexa as others can, and it lacks native temperature sensors. It also doesn’t offer as much control over your climate as, say, Google’s third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat.</p><div id=\"5KUuxh\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10907379\"></div></div><aside id=\"FFRb5I\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"You can now tell Alexa to plant a tree\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/11/23020190/amazon-alexa-tree-planting-climate-debate\"},{\"title\":\"Apple says it’s using more recycled materials than ever before \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23031930/apple-recycled-materials-taz-machine-earth-day\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"Zc7HLd\">Deal hunters looking for a great desktop computer can currently pick up Apple’s M1-powered Mac Mini at an all-time low in both configurations. When <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing the desktop machine</a>, we found that it outperformed Intel-based Macs and even the M1-equipped, 13-inch MacBook Pro thanks to its efficiently cooled chassis. If you don’t mind that it only offers two UCB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and lacks a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, you can buy the <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%E2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2C-8-core-gpu-%E2%80%93-8gb-memory-%E2%80%93-256gb-ssd-%E2%80%93--silver.product.100694159.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">256GB model for $569.99 ($129 off) now at Costco</a>. The deal is available to non-members as well, but they will have to pay an additional 5 percent surcharge of $33.50.</p><p id=\"68MN2C\">If you’re in need of additional storage, you can save $149 on the 512GB version, which is on sale for $749.99 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2020-Apple-Mini-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5P7TLW?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> — note that the discount applies at checkout — and <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/.product.100694240.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Costco</a>. Non-members can also pick it up at Costco with a 5 percent surcharge for $793.49.</p><div id=\"kNLtfr\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11154457\"></div></div><p id=\"5o0lyW\">When your smartphone is running low on battery, a small portable charger like Anker’s PowerPort III Nano can be a lifesaver. The USB-C charger is about as wide as a quarter and weighs about an ounce, yet it also offers 20W of power. That means it can quickly charge a variety of devices, including recent phones like the iPhone 13 and Samsung Galaxy S22 as well as iPads, AirPods, and more. It’s a handy accessory to have and, today, the white model is only <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Anker-Adapter-PowerPort-iPhone/dp/B07WRKXQ8W/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$13.59 at Amazon</a> or <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fanker-nano-20w-1-port-usb-c-wall-charger-white%2F-%2FA-81062898&amp;subid1=TheVergeDailyDealsApril222022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, instead of its usual $16.99. It’s a modest discount, but the best one we’ve seen this year. Note, however, that you’ll have to supply your own cable to use with the charger.</p><div id=\"PmwFYq\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11154896\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3p-vKHrb6XdcJ31r3kexPmlDOXI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883440/vpavic_210924_4766_0022_2.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>We were big fans of the iPad Mini’s larger screen.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"vVMay6\">As <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2022/4/20/23031992/apple-ipad-air-pro-jbl-bluetooth-speaker-polk-soundbar-irobot-roomba-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">we mentioned earlier this week</a>, Amazon has been dropping some great deals on the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2020 iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2021 iPad Pro</a>, but it looks like it’s not stopping there. Once again, the retailer is cutting prices on yet another iPad: the latest iPad Mini. If you prefer a smaller tablet, you can buy the 64GB, LTE-equipped iPad Mini for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9GM743?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$589.99 instead of $649 at Amazon</a>, which is the lowest price we’ve seen for this configuration. <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/apple-ipad-mini-(6th-generation)-wi-fi-%2b-cellular%2c-64gb.product.100806402.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Costco is also offering members the same discount</a>, which non-members can get for a 5 percent surcharge.</p><p id=\"7yNkcH\">The new iPad Mini comes with an 8.3-inch screen that’s larger than that of its predecessor as well as a design that resembles the look and feel of Apple’s latest tablets. Like the 2021 iPad Pro and iPad Air, it’s also compatible with the second-gen Apple Pencil, which can wirelessly charge while magnetically attached to the side of the tablet. It also boasts a 12MP rear camera and Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Center Stage feature</a>, which allows the front-facing camera to digitally pan and zoom in during video calls. The 2021 model is also equipped with a USB-C port and Apple’s A15 Bionic processor, which is speedy but admittedly not as powerful as anything in Apple’s M1 chip. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"SHIhXD\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11155095\"></div></div><aside id=\"CnoVc8\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How the M1-powered iPad Air compares to other iPad models\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22967629/apple-ipad-air-2022-pro-mini-specs-comparison\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"zVV6Sf\">If you’ve been in the market for a smart video doorbell, Google’s new Nest Doorbell is on sale for one of its better prices to date. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-Doorbell-Battery-Wireless/dp/B09K6XXJXX/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga01318us.html&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup042222\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adorama</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cf1L0G8uYpV\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://store.google.com/config/nest_doorbell_battery\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1657267-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02076_us_nest_hello_video_doorbell.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F4%2F22%2F23035493%2Famazon-smart-thermostat-apple-mac-mini-anker-google-nest-ipad-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H</a> are selling the smart video doorbell right now for $149.99 instead of $179.99, which is $20 shy of its Black Friday price.</p><p id=\"xy4w5z\">As Google’s first battery-powered smart video doorbell, you can install it in many more homes than the older wired version. The attractive device also comes equipped with a camera capable of recording at 30 frames per second with HDR and night vision, and it can detect people, animals, vehicles, and packages. While its video resolution is limited to 960 x 1280 pixels and it showcases a narrower field of view than the older model, the image quality is still good. Plus, its tall, oblong shape provides for a better head-to-toe view of people standing outside your door.</p><p id=\"g7jgr5\">Note, however, that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/18/22941018/google-nest-video-doorbell-nest-cam-cold-weather-charging-woes\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recent reports reveal</a> the battery-powered Nest can’t charge at temperatures below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, which could be a big drawback for those living in colder climates. Then again, the battery lasts between six and eight weeks, which is better than many video doorbells though not as handy as a wired model. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"pXuvan\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10873038\"></div></div><h2 id=\"jijNFc\">Other deals we’re digging today</h2><ul><li id=\"KBI3EX\">TP-Link’s Kasa Smart Plug Wi-Fi Power Strip comes with six smart outlets and three USB ports, and you can use it to remotely control devices and schedule which outlets you can turn on using your smartphone.
