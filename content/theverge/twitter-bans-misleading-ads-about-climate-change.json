The IPCC has published a couple of landmark <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/\">reports</a> on the crisis over the past few months that break down what needs to be done to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22953552/sea-walls-coastal-cities-climate-change-adaptation-united-nations-report\">adapt</a> to the changes<strong> </strong>that are already unfolding as well as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009804/united-nations-climate-change-report-greenhouse-emissions-2030-ipcc\">how to avert even more severe consequences</a> in the future, like intensifying <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc\">weather disasters</a> and ferocious wildfire seasons.</p><p id=\"2cjNAZ\">Twitter also said that it will soon share more details about how it plans to “add reliable, authoritative context” about climate change on its platform. Those conversations have gotten much louder over the past year, according to the company. Talk about “sustainability” on the platform has grown by over 150 percent since 2021, Twitter says. Discussions on “decarbonization,” aka getting rid of greenhouse gas emissions that come from burning fossil fuels, are also up 50 percent. Other environmental conversations are heating up, too. Chatter about reducing waste grew by more than 100 percent over the same time period. </p><p id=\"gQk828\">Twitter’s new announcement is also part of a broader social media saga to stop lies about climate change. Other companies have made similar commitments, with varying success. </p><p id=\"b9krE6\">Google made a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321\">commitment</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715102/google-youtube-climate-change-deniers-ads-monetization\">October 2021 </a>to stop allowing ads that feature climate denial or that monetize climate misinformation. Even so, a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22838243/google-ads-climate-change-denial\">report</a> published soon after the new policy went into effect found that Google was still placing<strong> </strong>ads on climate-denying content. Google told <em>The Verge</em> at the time that it reviewed the content and decided to take “appropriate enforcement actions.” Facebook has also come under fire for <a href=\"https://www.counterhate.com/post/facebook-failing-to-flag-harmful-climate-misinformation-new-research-finds\">failing to label</a> climate misinformation despite its <a href=\"https://about.facebook.com/actions/promoting-safety-and-expression/?utm_source=Search&amp;utm_medium=google&amp;utm_campaign=USPublicAffairs&amp;utm_content=Search-facebook%20misinformation-571021546253\">policy</a> on flagging such content. Another <a href=\"https://stopfundingheat.info/facebook-in-denial/\">report</a> about the platform published last November also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763795/facebook-climate-denial-worse-study\">found</a> a sharp rise in interactions with posts from Facebook pages and groups focused on spreading climate misinformation.</p><aside id=\"vKgXuO\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"What Elon Musk’s Twitter ‘free speech’ promises miss \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/15/23025120/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech-government-censorship\"}]}'></div></aside><aside id=\"nIchL1\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Elon Musk wants to buy Twitter: Here’s everything you need to know \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23026874/elon-musk-twitter-buyout-news-updates\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"kj1Qmn\"></p><p id=\"6cuRm1\"></p><p id=\"26sZL8\"></p><p id=\"pCipjt\"></p>",
