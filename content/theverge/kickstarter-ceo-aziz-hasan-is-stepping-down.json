In a blog titled “<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/moving-forward-with-gratitude\">Moving Forward, with Gratitude</a>,” Hasan says COO Sean Leow will be interim CEO and that the search for a permanent replacement is already underway.</p><p id=\"wataNR\">In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90733608/kickstarters-ceo-is-stepping-down-citing-personal-reflection?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;utm_content=rss\"><em>Fast Company</em></a>, Hasan says “personal reflections” and a desire to spend more time with his family informed his decision to leave Kickstarter after three years. </p><p id=\"ri4VuV\">“I am so proud of the work we’ve done together,” Hasan writes. “Leading such a passionate, skilled, and dedicated team through intense moments of change, milestone victories, and complex challenges has been a humbling and rewarding experience.”</p><p id=\"nrjHSC\">He touted the company’s successes under his leadership, including reaching $6 billion raised in pledges by 20 million backers. </p><p id=\"6t7wEI\">Hasan’s announcement comes a few months after the company announced it would develop a decentralized version of Kickstarter and move on to the blockchain. Backlash soon followed, forcing the company to issue a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/articles/we-won-t-make-changes-to-kickstarter-without-you\">follow-up statement</a> saying it would slow down the rollout to “listen to [the] feedback” and address concerns from creators and backers.</p><p id=\"SDMuSp\">Kickstarter and company leadership also faced criticism in 2019 — just months after Hasan was named CEO — for its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18627052/kickstarter-union-nlrb-election\">refusal to voluntarily recognize</a> Kickstarter United, its employee union. Workers voted the following year to unionize, becoming one of the first tech unions in the US. That same year, Kickstarter <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257585/kickstarter-layoffs-employees-union-negotiations-severance\">lost about 40 percent of its workforce</a> to layoffs and buyouts as the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21228412/kickstarter-layoffs-planned-coronavirus-project-declines-crowdfunding-union\">grappled with a steep drop in new projects</a> early in the pandemic.</p><p id=\"2EcJDJ\">Hasan will remain on as an advisor for the next several months as the Kickstarter Board of Directors looks for a new CEO. His last day will be April 4th. </p>",
