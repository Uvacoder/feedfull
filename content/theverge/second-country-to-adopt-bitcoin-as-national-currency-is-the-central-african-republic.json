(Though <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20220427-central-african-republic-adopts-bitcoin-as-legal-currency\">former CAR prime minister Martin Ziguele complained</a> the bill was approved “by proclamation.”) The office of CAR president Faustin-Archange Touadera claimed the move would “improve the conditions of Central African citizens” and distinguish CAR as “of the world’s boldest and most visionary countries.”</p><p id=\"T2TYrI\">However, geopolitical analysts and financial experts are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/bitcoin-adoption-by-central-african-republic-baffles-cryptoverse-2022-04-28/\">confused</a> by motivations for the move. CAR is a landlocked nation that is rich in resources like gold and uranium, but remains one of the world’s poorest countries. It has been wracked by civil war since 2012, and only <a href=\"https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2021-central-african-republic\">11 percent</a> of the 4.8 million population have access to the internet. It is one of six states in Africa to use the Central African CFA franc as its currency — “a regional currency that is backed by France and pegged to the Euro,” <a href=\"https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=0b82e826-20a2-42f8-a376-f3dbe1adadc7\">according to law firm</a> Baker McKenzie.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"F2LG4m\"><q>“It’s a big middle finger to the French economic system”</q></aside></div><p id=\"ts6lKT\">Some have suggested that CAR’s adoption of Bitcoin is an attempt to undermine the CFA franc and offer a rebuke to the country’s former colonial power, France. “It’s a big middle finger to the French economic system,” Chris Maurice, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Yellow Card, which focuses on users in Africa, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/bitcoin-adoption-by-central-african-republic-baffles-cryptoverse-2022-04-28/\">told <em>Reuters</em></a>. </p><p id=\"TJkiyj\">Others say the move could be tied to CAR’s close relationship with Russia. CAR was one of the few nations that chose to <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2022/03/un-vote-russia-invasion-shows-changing-africa\">abstain</a> from a United Nations vote condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while the country’s government has been condemned for deploying mercenaries from Russia’s Wagner Group to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/30/russian-mercenaries-accused-of-human-rights-abuses-in-car-un-group-experts-wagner-group-violence-election\">fight rebel groups</a>. </p><p id=\"DqOwSN\">“The context, given the systemic corruption and a Russian partner facing international sanctions, does encourage suspicion,” analyst Thierry Vircoulon of the French Institute of International Relations, told the AFP news agency (via <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-61248809\"><em>BBC News</em></a>). </p>",
