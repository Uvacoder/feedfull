Not on the level of my 1990s <em>Solitaire </em>addiction, but I can’t seem to stop spinning this damn gear every time I open Notepad now. <em>Spin, spin, spin</em>.</p><p id=\"ZPojwa\">I don’t know why Microsoft added this tiny animation that most people will never discover, but I love this little Windows Easter egg. It’s not limited to Notepad either. The latest test versions of Windows 11 include a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22892879/microsoft-windows-11-new-task-manager-design\">new Task Manager UI</a>, and there’s a gear you can spin there too. That means every time I go to force crash an app in Task Manager, I’m gonna spend more time than I should spinning the little gear in the corner.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/36KYhx-NRF3k-IXDLX9oofcenfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23342123/taskmanagergear.gif\">      <figcaption><em>You can also spin the gear in the new Windows 11 Task Manager.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"y2BQPz\">I shouldn’t really be surprised that this exists, because Microsoft does love a good Easter egg. The company celebrated 20 years of Xbox last year <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22785059/microsoft-halo-xbox-translucent-controller-hands-on\">with secret symbols</a> on its limited edition controllers and Xbox Series X console. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/15/5617234/clippy-replaces-cortana-in-windows-phone-easter-egg\">Clippy also replaced Cortana</a> in a Windows Phone Easter egg, and a <em>SkiFree</em>-like surfing game made its way into Microsoft Edge a couple of years ago. </p><aside id=\"6C42es\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Windows 11 is full of delightful detail \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575431/microsoft-windows-11-design-animations-start-menu\"},{\"title\":\"Windows 11 review: a familiar home that’s still being renovated\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"K4MLin\">Some of Microsoft’s Easter eggs are so well hidden that they don’t get discovered for decades. A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448039/20-year-old-xbox-easter-egg-developer-revealed\">20-year-old Xbox Easter egg</a> was discovered last year, just weeks after another hidden prompt was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thebookisclosed/status/1375531201071620100\">found in Windows 95</a>.</p><p id=\"8Jr6bc\">Now, if you email or tweet me and wonder why I haven’t replied... I’m probably busy spinning a gear in Notepad.</p>",
