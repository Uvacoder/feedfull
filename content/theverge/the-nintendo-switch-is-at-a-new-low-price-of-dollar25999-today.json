Right now, you can get a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild\">Nintendo Switch</a> console with neon blue and red Joy-Cons for just $259.99 at <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Console-with-Neon-Blue-Red-Joy-Con%2F709776123&amp;subid1=vergenintendoswitchbreakout051122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VGRJDFY?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, and <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=vergenintendoswitchbreakout051122&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-joy-con-controller%2F204620.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GameStop</a>. That’s $40 off Nintendo’s standard Switch console. Sure, it’s not the fancier <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review\">OLED model</a> that came out last year, but this discounted price is $90 less than that model, and it, of course, plays all the same games.</p><div id=\"6paFl3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10988261\"></div></div><p id=\"lQmWeo\">The Nintendo Switch may feel like an aging console these days, as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22958526/nintendo-switch-five-year-anniversary-console-gaming\">it’s five years old</a>, but it’s still bolstered by excellent first-party Nintendo titles and a wealth of indie games — all of which you can take on the go or play docked on a TV. While many fans are thirsty for some kind of 4K-capable <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled\">Switch Pro</a>, there’s a reason Nintendo continues to have strong sales, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23064853/nintendo-earnings-q4-2021-switch-sales-forecast-2022\">even if it may have peaked</a>.</p><p id=\"72z2Tl\">The standard Switch comes with a 720p 6.2-inch touchscreen and 32GB of onboard storage that you can — and should — upgrade with a microSD card. When playing on your TV with the included dock, it displays at 1080p resolution. </p><p id=\"t2y56u\">As for games and accessories, there’s no shortage of options out there, many of which have been discounted recently. Here are a few worthy of your consideration:</p><div id=\"w5Uk9A\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11004970\"></div></div><div id=\"7p5kA2\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11130360\"></div></div><div id=\"fBPv7I\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11183276\"></div></div><div id=\"BSdrcR\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11062719\"></div></div><div id=\"zqTVmu\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11186702\"></div></div><div id=\"5sq8as\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9556339\"></div></div><p id=\"i6We2w\">Be sure to follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VergeDeals\">@VergeDeals on Twitter</a> as well as subscribe to our <em>Verge Deals</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters\">newsletter</a>, where we often track and cover gaming deals, so you can find more chances like this one and save on games and peripherals for your Switch, other consoles, or PC.</p><aside id=\"OeI4Ru\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside><p id=\"AY6iiJ\"><em><strong>Update May 11th, 11:44AM ET:</strong></em><em> GameStop is now matching Amazon and Walmart’s current deal on the Nintendo Switch.
