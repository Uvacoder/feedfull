That’s because <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP02AM/A/thunderbolt-4-pro-cable-3-m\">Apple’s three-meter Thunderbolt 4 Pro Cable</a> isn’t just any ol’ cord — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22968576/apple-3m-thunderbolt-4-cable\">it’s still</a> the <em>only </em>Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C / USB 4 cable on the market at anywhere near its length. </p><p id=\"IizMTp\">Want a cable that can transmit 40 gigabits per second of Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4 data, up to 8K video, and 100W of USB-C PD power to a big MacBook Pro nearly 10 feet away? It’s your only game in town. Every other company that sells a Thunderbolt 4 cable — including <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?xcust=___vg__p_22732617__t_w__d_D&amp;id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.belkin.com/us/cables/data/connect-thunderbolt-4-cable/p/p-inz002/&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22968576/apple-3m-thunderbolt-4-cable\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Belkin</a>, <a href=\"http://shop.caldigit.com/us/index.php?route=product/category&amp;path=84_72\">CalDigit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cablematters.com/c-132-cables.aspx?PageNum=1&amp;SortBy=pricedown\">CableMatters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cablestogo.com/shop-by-application/return-to-office/6ft-2m-thunderbolt-4-usb-c-active-cable-40gbps/p/cg-c2g28887\">CTG</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feshop.macsales.com%2Fshop%2Fowc-thunderbolt-4-cables&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F5%2F4%2F23057158%2Fapple-thunderbolt-4-cable-3-meter-on-sale-price-usb-4\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OWC</a>, and <a href=\"https://plugable.com/collections/usb-cables\">Plugable</a> — tops out at two meters (6.6 feet). Which makes those other cables roughly just half a foot longer than Apple’s previous 1.8-meter Thunderbolt 4 cord.</p><p id=\"D2MvwD\">It’s also a <em>braided</em> cable, which makes me happy, not that I’m going to buy one because $159 is enough scratch that I will gladly wait until other cable manufacturers catch up. </p><p id=\"Ggiz7h\">If you <em>are</em> the kind of person who’d be perfectly satisfied with a two-meter, non-braided cable without the Apple and “Pro” labels, those other manufacturers’ Thunderbolt 4 cables currently range from $57 to $130.</p><p id=\"mnOYeM\">But if you want the Apple cable, it’s available in some Apple stores beginning today. A $9 “scheduled courier delivery” could get it to our Manhattan offices in just a couple of hours, though it looks like folks in Apple’s native SF Bay Area will have to wait until at least May 12th for delivery. </p><p id=\"W0mqCT\"></p>",
