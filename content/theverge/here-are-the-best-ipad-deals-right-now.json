Whether you’re after the high-end iPad Pro, or the most affordable Apple tablet, the entry-level iPad, there’s likely a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. </p><p id=\"H2aVlZ\">Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find the most notable deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at <em>The Verge </em>are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. </p><aside id=\"ehglg9\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals\"},{\"title\":\"The best deals on MacBooks right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"jzeS15\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10754964\"></div></div><h2 id=\"hb2n3u\">The best iPad (2021) deals</h2><p id=\"q5ZrvP\">Announced during Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey\">September iPhone 13 event</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade\">2021 iPad</a> is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom\">eighth-gen model from 2020</a>. The latter is essentially unavailable at this point, though. That being the case, you can occasionally purchase a <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFYL92LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-iPad-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray-8th-Generation&amp;subid1=TheVergeiPaddeals030122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">refurbished model</a> via <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFYL92LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-iPad-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray-8th-Generation&amp;subid1=TheVergeiPaddeals030122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a>, Woot, and other retailers.</p><p id=\"fMZ13y\">The current, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has 64GB of storage instead of 32GB. This model is currently available at Walmart for a modest discount at $309. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459, and the 256GB variant $609. </p><p id=\"WMpIom\">The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams\">Center Stage</a>, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.</p><div id=\"qnjdLM\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10752834\"></div></div><p id=\"5m6ZrK\">At the moment, there are currently no deals available on the base 256GB model, which is only available at its full price of $479. However, this model tends to get discounted to its lowest ever price of $449 at least once a month, so it definitely pays to wait.</p><aside id=\"MKkmFl\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade\"},{\"title\":\"10 of the best Apple Arcade games for your new iPhone or iPad\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22815442/iphone-ipad-best-games-apple-arcade-2021\"}]}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"njqbEo\">The best iPad Mini (2021) deals</h2><p id=\"jTw4HZ\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review\">sixth-generation iPad Mini</a> has a larger screen than its predecessor, along with a top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has forfeited its 3.5-millimeter headphone jack and dedicated home button in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.</p><p id=\"sBkkEE\">The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is, especially now that Apple and other retailers have officially discontinued selling the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet\">2019 model</a>.</p><div id=\"NMDW5P\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10743705\"></div></div><p id=\"zw4xQv\">Right now, discounts on the sixth-gen Mini are fairly limited and inventory can even be a bit scarce. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Wi-Fi-256GB/dp/B09G91LXFP/ref=sr_1_3?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-Mini-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F168720858%3F&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup032222\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> are both offering the 64GB model with Wi-Fi in select colorways for $459.

It’s not a massive markdown by any stretch, but it’s still the lowest price you can find right now for the tablet. </p><p id=\"yTQM5V\">The 2022 iteration of Apple’s lightweight tablet is similar in terms of its capabilities when measured against the previous-gen model, but still offers a handful of iterative upgrades. The most pronounced improvement is the M1 processor, which offers better performance, and the front-facing 12MP camera comes equipped with Apple’s Center Stage feature that helps to keep a moving subject centered when recording video, or during video calls. </p><div id=\"eCtRB1\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11075546\"></div></div><h2 id=\"9CXiCy\">The best iPad Air (2020) deals</h2><p id=\"v5sW0N\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review\">2020 iPad Air</a> has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen, as well as thinner bezels. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device.  As for sizes, the fourth-generation model comes in either a 64GB or 256GB configuration. The Wi-Fi models start at around $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. </p><p id=\"i5hHzQ\">At the moment, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J66ZMY7?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgPyrwaDmt7\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> are selling the 64GB base model with Wi-Fi in various colorways for $499, which is a $100 discount but is still a bit higher than the midrange slate’s all-time low of $489.99. The lowest price for its LTE-equipped counterpart can<a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-Cellular-64GB-Space-Gray%2F563775517%3F&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup032222\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> curren</a>tly be found at <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-Cellular-64GB-Space-Gray%2F563775517\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>, with the green and rose gold colorways discounted to $629.99 instead of $729. If you prefer more storage, the 256GB, Wi-Fi model is on sale for about $649.99 ($100 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5SYG7S?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgSsmzCQ19n\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> in select colors.</p><div id=\"JhHVno\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9546269\"></div></div><h2 id=\"7PfM3l\">The best iPad Pro (2020) deals</h2><p id=\"9tR4OQ\">The fifth-generation, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">M1-equipped iPad Pro</a> came out last year, but there are still some lingering deals to be had on the prior <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iPad Pro from 2020</a>. The fourth-gen iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model — when this design was first established — aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike some of the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet, instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor.</p><p id=\"I3fOsz\">If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgDfxngfehC\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">512GB, Wi-Fi configuration is available on clearance at Best Buy for $934.99</a>, about $165 off its original price of $1,099. If you prefer the bigger option, the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgDfB6NbNJH\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">12.9-inch, 256GB model with Wi-Fi is also on clearance at Best Buy for the same price</a>. Ultimately, it comes down to your preference between a smaller screen with 512GB of storage or a larger display with a respectable 256GB. The 2020 iPad Pro is no longer available at many retailers, however, so we’ll likely see it phased out relatively soon. </p><div id=\"dnrxd6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10917835\"></div></div><div id=\"6KEsdE\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10994402\"></div></div><h2 id=\"0LPHck\">The best iPad Pro (2021) deals</h2><p id=\"M0IoQA\">The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro</a> is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest MacBook Air — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.</p><aside id=\"kIHPXF\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"I5hP3e\">If the latest model is what you’re after, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi starts at $799.
