You may also still be running Windows 10 if you’re a business user with a workflow still optimized for Windows 10 or a leisure user who just prefers it. Motives aside, there are a lot of us. And, fortunately, we now have an update available. </p><p id=\"XldGfI\">Windows 10 version 21H2 is now available for broad deployment <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-10-21h2\">according to Microsoft</a> (first spotted by <a href=\"https://www.neowin.net/news/windows-10-21h2-is-now-available-to-everyone-and-ready-for-broad-deployment/\"><em>Neowin</em></a>). If you’re not an IT administrator, the <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/93c5c27c-f96e-43c2-a08e-5812d92f220d?ocid=wusettings#windowsupdate=19044\">changes in this update</a> likely won’t be too interesting to you. It’s stuff like “GPU compute support for the Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL)” and “Wi-Fi WPA3-Personal H2E support.” If you <em>are </em>an IT administrator, Microsoft has an <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-10-version-21h2\">article for you</a> detailing the updates further. </p><p id=\"49JWzl\">But, keeping your PC up to date is a good security practice in general, and even small updates often pave the way for bigger features down the line. You’ll also need to update at some point anyway because Microsoft does <a href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-10-version-21h2-available-to-everyone/\">drop support</a> for old versions of Windows 10 after certain periods of time.</p><h2 id=\"JQmk2s\">How to update to Windows 10 21H2</h2>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"A screenshot of a Windows 10 desktop. “Check” is written in the search bar and “Check for Updates” is highlighted in the start menu.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BWjrtxgelTqnmMqJXhS7ZoVt4v8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23400471/win10_1.png\">      <figcaption><em>You can also go find it manually, but why?</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"jnkbgk\">First, navigate to the updates section of the Settings application.
