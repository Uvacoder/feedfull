More than 20 million properties across the continental US are threatened by at least “moderate” wildfire risk. Those homes have up to a 6 percent chance of being in a blaze at some point over a 30-year timespan, the typical timeframe for a home mortgage. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"htaVV3\"><iframe title=\"Wildfire Risk Rating\" aria-label=\"Table\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-sZ5p5\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sZ5p5/4/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"  height=\"459\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div></div><p id=\"I5O1NB\"></p><p id=\"QzECui\">Even a 1 percent chance of being in a wildfire is worth taking seriously. In comparison, the federal government considers an area with a 1 percent chance of flooding in a given year as a “<a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/glossary/flood-zones#:~:text=SFHA%20are%20defined%20as%20the,flood%20or%20100%2Dyear%20flood.\">Special Flood Hazard Area</a>” on maps used to determine flood insurance rates. But unlike flooding, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/16/climate/wildfire-risk-map-properties.html\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reports, there hasn’t been comprehensive property-level data on wildfire risk until now.</p><p id=\"kECgTL\">Now, you can type an address into First Street’s <a href=\"https://firststreet.org/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template\">online search tool</a> to see the organization’s fire risk rating for that property (you’ll also find a flood risk rating from First Street). The information will also be incorporated into Realtor.com. </p><p id=\"LZYvGC\">To assess each property’s risk, First Street <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFwbqNAXoFo\">built a peer-reviewed model</a> using government data on available fuels (dry vegetation) and weather patterns. Then it was able to simulate over 100 million wildfires to see which properties they might threaten. </p><div class=\"c-float-left\"><div id=\"UaeNcD\"><iframe title=\"Percentage of US properties facing wildfire risk\" aria-label=\"Pie Chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-2usrZ\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2usrZ/6/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"  height=\"412\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div></div><p id=\"pceS0a\"></p><p id=\"EOZXvk\">Using First Street’s Data, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2022/wildfire-risk-map-us/\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> reports that one in six Americans now lives in a place with “significant” wildfire risk. </p><p id=\"vgEXpj\">Wildfire seasons have become <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2011048118\">more intense</a> as climate change makes the Western US hotter and drier. The past century of fire suppression has also made fires more devastating when they do break out since suppression tactics have allowed dry vegetation to build up to dangerous levels instead of allowing them to burn off in smaller, sporadic blazes. On top of that, residents have moved deeper into vulnerable locations where urban development meets fire-prone ecosystems, especially in states with soaring housing prices like California. There’s been an almost tenfold increase in costs associated with wildfires from $8.5 billion between 2012 and 2016 to $79.8 billion in costs from 2018 to 2021, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Map of properties facing wildfire risk in the US; annual likelihood of wildfire in 30 years.&amp;nbsp;\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPhcLZE7Cna3tD8b1klWXj1dLUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23475412/among_properties_with_risk_annual_likelihood_in_30_years.jpg\">      <cite>Image: First Street Foundation</cite>      <figcaption><em>Among properties facing wildfire risk, annual likelihood of wildfire in 30 years. </em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"paMdhU\">Things are only going to get riskier as climate change continues to heat the planet, <em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em> and First Street both warn.
