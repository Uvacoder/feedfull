There’s <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fasrock-radeon-rx-6400-rx6400-cli-4g%2Fp%2FN82E16814930068\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a $159.99 ASRock Challenger</a> and a <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fxfx-radeon-rx-6400-rx-64xl4sfg2%2Fp%2FN82E16814150868\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$169.99 XFX Speedster SWFT105</a> in stock at Newegg right now — with <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsapphire-radeon-rx-6400-11315-01-20g%2Fp%2FN82E16814202416\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a $159.99 Sapphire Pulse card</a> also on the way.</p><p id=\"vVrMlU\">Intriguingly, every one of these cards appears to be a miniature model, and many of them are single-slot, low-profile GPUs that can fit in much narrower cases. </p><p id=\"AvwfSb\">(If you’re not familiar with low-profile GPUs, check out the pics above and below — they typically come with a shorter, swappable metal PCI-Express bracket like the one you see on the Sapphire card at the top of this post; the XFX card below is showing off its longer bracket for scale, but it should come with both.)</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2m5aYfJMJw8bHujNjrfhK_SVLdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23404005/xfx_6400.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>This XFX card looks short, and it’ll be shorter if you attach its low-profile PCIe bracket.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"NQln9Q\">Mind you, there’s a reason these cards don’t need to be big! They’re <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-6400\">only rated at 53W of power</a>, less than half the power of even the lackluster RX 6500 XT, with only 12 compute units (down from 16), lower clocks, slower RAM, only 128GB per second of bandwidth, and just two display outputs. (Some of this is less surprising when you consider <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-navi-24-gpu-was-designed-for-ryzen-6000-laptops\">that its Navi24 GPU was originally designed for laptops</a>.) On the plus side, you don’t need an extra power connector: the card can draw all its power from the PCI-Express slot. </p><p id=\"YfRXAE\">According to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWsQJC-mvQ\">one early video review</a>, it looks like it will struggle with games like <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> even at 1080p and on low settings but should be fine for the likes of <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><aside id=\"9mvty9\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT meta-review: even desperate gamers should think twice\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22892273/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-meta-review-gpu-graphics-card\"},{\"title\":\"Nvidia and AMD GPUs are returning to shelves and prices are finally falling\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23031309/nvidia-amd-gpu-price-in-stock-retail-ebay\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"lkDPnB\">Know that while all RX 6400 models we’ve seen so far are miniature (big hat tips <a href=\"https://videocardz.com/amd\">to <em>VideoCardz</em></a> and <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-rx-6400-launched-first-rdna-graphics-card-to-come-in-low-profile-flavors-159-usd/\"><em>Wccftech</em></a> for rounding up most of them), not all of them are low-profile. Many are two slots wide, some have two fans, and Gigabyte even has a model (below) that’s all of the above.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gPsGO_Inigict_w_DVutz8MEmy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23404086/gigabyte_rx_6400.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>This Gigabyte model is squat but seemingly long and wide.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"cKUt73\"></p><p id=\"8Wdv5P\"></p>",
