The company brought it to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q72dA533sCg&amp;ab_channel=MarquesBrownlee\">YouTubers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a38137530/ford-f100-eluminator/\">automotive trade shows</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJQZzg6rWyo&amp;ab_channel=JayLeno%27sGarage\">Jay Leno</a>, and even us. And we all agreed: we want this truck in our own garages.</p><p id=\"ohwwFN\">But for Ford, this car was far more than a pretty old new truck — it was a way to show off its new electric crate motor, <a href=\"https://performanceparts.ford.com/part/M-9000-MACHE\">the M-9000-MACHE</a>, or the same electric motor that is in Ford’s all-electric <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/suvs/mach-e/models/mach-e-gt/\">Mustang Mach-E GT</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BO3RlDZULMbRiT7GdPZgPFSV7qw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418198/BFARSACE_220426_5167_09.jpg\">      <cite><em>Becca Farsace / The Verge</em></cite>      <figcaption><em>Inside the F-100 Eluminator is two M-9000-MACHE electric motors.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"YBdzKy\">A crate motor is an engine sold separately from a vehicle. They have predominately served as a way for car enthusiasts and hobbyists to modify their cars, and they are incredibly common. But almost all of these crate motors run on some sort of fuel, which is why Ford’s e-crate motor is worth parading around. Now while they <a href=\"https://chargedevs.com/newswire/ev-west-unveils-tesla-crate-motor-for-ev-conversion-projects/\">aren’t the only company selling</a> an e-crate motor, they certainly are the first major automotive brand to bring one to market and, more impressively, keeping it under $5,000. </p><p id=\"cFuPoC\">In my latest video, I went to <a href=\"https://electrifiedgarage.com/\">Electrified Garage</a> in Ocala, Florida, an electric vehicle repair shop known for repairing Teslas at <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/independent-garage-fixes-tesla-700-tesla-charged-16000\">lower rates</a> than Tesla itself, and spoke to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F5%2F3%2F23053536%2Fford-tesla-f100-mustang-gt-right-to-repair\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iFixit.com</a>, one of the leading forces in the right to repair movement, to figure out why this is so important and how far we really are from being able to fix electric vehicles for ourself. Let me know what you think, bud!</p><p id=\"kMgRyH\"></p><p id=\"ZZJjkV\"></p>",
