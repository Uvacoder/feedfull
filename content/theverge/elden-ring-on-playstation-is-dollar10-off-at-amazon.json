It has taken over the landscape of gaming discourse, and for good reason. If you primarily play games on Sony’s PlayStation consoles, now is the perfect time to jump into FromSoftware’s open-world take on its acclaimed dark fantasy “Souls-like” formula. Amazon has both the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Elden-Ring-PlayStation-4/dp/B07SPYK271?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PS4</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Elden-Ring-PlayStation-4/dp/B09743F8P6?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PS5 physical</a> versions of Elden Ring for $49.94 — a discount of about $10. </p><p id=\"tbkQwi\">That may not sound like a huge price cut, but the only sales on this hot title so far have been on the Xbox and PC versions. Plus, when you factor in how many hours you can pour into The Lands Between (many of us at <em>The Verge </em>have crossed the 100-hour mark on just our first playthrough), it makes it an even more significant value proposition. And if you get stuck, <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough\">our pals at <em>Polygon</em></a><em> </em>have written extensive guides to help you get un-stuck. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>. </p><aside id=\"y8WXLY\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"I tried to duo with ‘Let me solo her’ in Elden Ring, and it didn’t go well\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23025610/elden-ring-pc-let-me-solo-her-malenia-boss\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"udSz0T\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11083020\"></div></div><p id=\"zy7tMR\">Even if you are a PlayStation gamer, this next Xbox deal is still applicable to you. Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F6JQE8ZOJ1IHX&amp;subid1=vergedailydeals050722\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Stereo Headset is down to its lowest price of $45</a> once again at Walmart. This wired headset may look like a proprietary product for Xbox, but its 3.5mm headphone cable means that it can work just as well on a PS4 or PS5 by plugging it into the controller. One of its handiest features — the rotating earcup that adjusts volume — even works on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles. This headset’s flexible compatibility also extends to the PC and Nintendo Switch as well.</p><p id=\"zgRumu\">While there are a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy\">whole lot of great headsets out there</a> that offer many more features, the Xbox Stereo Headset is a great bang-for-your-buck if you want something that’s a little nicer than the most no-frills options on the market. The audio quality may not be the best for music, but it sounds good for games, and it’s paired with a good microphone. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22933892/microsoft-xbox-stereo-headset-review-gaming-headphones\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><aside id=\"KWSu9B\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best gaming headset deals you can get right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22876408/best-gaming-headset-deals-sales\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"CGT2Gd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10860198\"></div></div><p id=\"7RX61Q\">If you’re in the market for a Chromebook that feels more laptop than tablet, the Lenovo Flex 5 is a perfect midrange option that doesn’t break the bank, or feel too cheap. The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/chbC1q8RDpP\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">13-inch Flex 5 is down to $299</a> at Best Buy — a savings of $120 off its regular price of $419. This is a base-model with a Pentium 7505 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of eMMC storage. So while it’s not going to win many spec wars, it offers a lot at this discounted price, including and one of the best backlit keyboards among all Chromebooks we’ve used. </p><p id=\"0Yv9U1\">The Lenovo Flex 5 also has a much better port selection than most Chromebooks in this price range, featuring a microSD card slot and USB-C connections on both sides. Its main caveat is battery life, but unless you’re traveling frequently, it’s great to use as a traditional laptop or folded into tent mode with its touchscreen. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22598860/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><aside id=\"YxhHgv\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best Chromebook for 2022\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"DP0QaS\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11180169\"></div></div><p id=\"0b4Ryd\">Our final main deal for today is one that we covered earlier this week, but it’s such a good one that it’s worth mentioning again before the sale ends.

This hybrid vacuum and mop usually sells for $649.99 and offers a lot great features, such as spot-cleaning, mapping software to navigate your home more efficiently, and it even automatically lifts its mop when rolling over carpeting. You can get the same S7 vacuum in a Plus version that includes a self-emptying dock for around $950, but rest assured that you can save the money and skip that added cost, as it has an unfortunate tendency of clogging.</p><p id=\"tHNJWO\">While battery life could be better, the Roborock S7 is one of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">our top picks for the overall best robot vacuums you can buy</a>, and it’s the overall best hybrid with a mop.
