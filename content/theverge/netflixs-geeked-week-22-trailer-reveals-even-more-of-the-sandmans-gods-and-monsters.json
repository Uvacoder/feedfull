While we’re still a few weeks out from the 2022 exhibition, a new teaser trailer for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527983/netflix-geeked-week-anime-trailers-mobile-suit-gundam-godzilla\">the week of reveals and announcements</a> definitely makes it seem like the wait’s going to be worth it.</p><p id=\"yWzU50\">Over the course of Geeked Week’s five days, Netflix is set to spotlight more than 60 different projects currently in development, including <em>The Umbrella Academy</em>’s third season, <em>Stranger Things 4</em>, <em>Resident Evil</em>, and <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em>.<em> </em>In addition to those series, the new trailer for Geeked Week features quite a few new glimpses of Netflix’s live-action adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s <em>The Sandman</em> starring Tom Sturridge as Dream and Gwendoline Christie as Lucifer. Because Netflix has so much planned for Geeked Week, the streamer’s smartly choosing to dedicate each day of the event to different kinds of content: episodic series, followed by film, animation, an entire day dedicated to <em>Stranger Things</em>, and finally, a look at some of Netflix’s upcoming games.</p><p id=\"PDcFEN\">Netflix Geeked Week runs from June 6th to June 10th.</p><div id=\"BPndMx\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Geeked Week 2022 is about to be out of this world with Stranger Things, The Sandman, The Gray Man and more coming your way June 6-10.     <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GeekedWeek</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/D8l07DB6yc\">pic.twitter.com/D8l07DB6yc</a></p>— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1526200829400817664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 16, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>",
