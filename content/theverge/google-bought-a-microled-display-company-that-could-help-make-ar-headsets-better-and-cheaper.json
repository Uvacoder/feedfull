We learned in January that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833801/google-augmented-reality-operating-system-ar-os-team-mark-lucovsky\">Google Labs is building an AR headset called “Project Iris,”</a> under the same management as the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442336/google-project-starline-3d-video-chat-platform\">Project Starline</a> high-res video chat demo shown during its I/O event last year.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPR3ZDumn5eo9AzXsfLOdLtCiHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23438736/raxium_demos.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Raxium</cite>  </figure><p id=\"HpV3ZY\">When <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-buys-hardware-startup-raxium-to-fuel-ar-ambitions\"><em>The Information</em></a> first reported Google’s Raxium purchase last month, it noted that MicroLED tech could be useful for building AR displays that are more energy-efficient than other solutions, but still look colorful. In addition, Raxium is working on “monolithic integration” for MicroLEDs, which <em>The Information</em> reports would mean manufacturing them out of the same kind of silicon used for most processors, potentially driving the price down significantly. Other companies working on MicroLED AR hardware have included Oppo, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22275972/apple-micro-oled-led-augemented-reality-display-thin-power-efficient\">Apple</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225605/vuzix-microled-smart-glasses-next-gen-ar-heads-up-display-ces-2021\">Vuzix</a>.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"Es8GhT\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Apple’s upcoming mixed reality headset will reportedly weigh less than an iPhone\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo\"},{\"title\":\"Behind Mark Zuckerberg’s big plans for AR glasses\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23022611/meta-facebook-nazare-ar-glasses-roadmap-2024\"},{\"title\":\"Snap’s first AR Spectacles are an ambitious, impractical start\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22819963/snap-ar-spectacles-glasses-hands-on-pictures-design-features\"}]}'></div></aside></div><p id=\"WpP0za\">As for the competition, Microsoft has already delivered an augmented reality device <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18235460/microsoft-hololens-2-price-specs-mixed-reality-ar-vr-business-work-features-mwc-2019\">with HoloLens</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23022611/meta-facebook-nazare-ar-glasses-roadmap-2024\">Meta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22819963/snap-ar-spectacles-glasses-hands-on-pictures-design-features\">Snap</a>, and others are reportedly investing heavily to create their own hardware that overlays information and images on top of the real world. </p><p id=\"V9H6Rg\"><a href=\"https://www.raxium.com/\">According to Raxium’s website</a>, a Super AMOLED screen on your phone has a pixel pitch (the distance between the center of one pixel, and the center of another pixel next to it) of about 50 microns, while its MicroLED could manage around 3.5 microns. It also boasts of “unprecedented efficiency” that’s more than five times better than any world record. </p><p id=\"rrPJf1\">Osterloh referenced both the size and efficiency in his blog post about the future display technologies Raxium might build. He said the company will join Google’s Devices &amp; Services team, and that its “technical expertise in this area will play a key role as we continue to invest in our hardware efforts.” </p><aside id=\"JEcAbL\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Google hardware is no longer a hobby  \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16405184/rick-osterloh-interview-new-google-hardware-vision-htc-deal\"},{\"title\":\"Google I/O takes place May 11th and 12th, and it will be fully available online \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981868/google-i-o-2022-may-11th-12th-online-virtual\"}]}'></div></aside>",
