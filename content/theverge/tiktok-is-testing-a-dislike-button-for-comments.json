In a <a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-ways-to-foster-kindness-and-safety-on-tiktok?\">blog post</a> on safety and community guidelines enforcement, TikTok says individuals can flag comments they find “irrelevant or inappropriate” without the dislike being visible to others. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1486791992394854401\">Some users</a> spotted different versions of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iniyaspip/status/1503241031638085634\">the option</a> earlier this year. </p><p id=\"6Ewply\">“This community feedback will add to the range of factors we already use to help keep the comment section consistently relevant and a place for genuine engagement,” TikTok says.</p><p id=\"Q0Yyqv\">TikTok users already can <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22590125/tiktok-not-like-how-to-algorithm-dislike-hide-videos-sounds\">dislike videos</a> to signal to the app that they aren’t interested in the content. The comment dislike button appears to be available in addition to the option to report a comment for community guideline violations.</p><p id=\"9u2oiK\">The company also says it’s experimenting with sending reminders about features like comment filtering and bulk block and delete to creators who receive a high volume of negative comments. Decisions about whether to roll out the feature in full will be made in the coming weeks, according to TikTok.</p><p id=\"s4rv6f\">In today's transparency report, TikTok says it removed over 85 million videos between October and December 2021 for violations — about 1 percent of all videos uploaded to the app. </p>",
