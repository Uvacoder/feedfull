It seems likely that Valve will promote games that are great for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review\">Steam Deck</a>, and hopefully by that time, many more people will have gotten their <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22582617/new-steam-deck-reservations-q2-q3-valve-hand-held\">highly-anticipated reservations</a>. (Sadly, my projected Q3 order availability means I’ll very likely miss out, at least when it comes to trying games out for the handheld.)  </p><p id=\"PFjnJY\">The mid-June scheduling means Steam Next Fest will be timed right around when E3 usually happens. While E3’s organizers have said the trade show <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870913/e3-2022-online-virtual-event-covid-19-pandemic-omicron\">won’t be in person this year</a> due to “the ongoing health risks surrounding COVID-19,” they haven’t announced specific dates for the event.</p>",
