This early prototype code has been removed from Preview and doesn't signal near future plans to bring raytracing support to consoles.</p>— Minecraft (@Minecraft) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Minecraft/status/1509600288319102996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 31, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"Mw5wgW\">Despite <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/03/16/xbox-series-x-tech/\">originally teasing</a> <em>Minecraft</em> ray tracing on the Xbox Series X two years ago, it’s clear Microsoft isn’t ready to roll this out in the near future. Microsoft’s statement does leave the door open for ray tracing to still appear on <em>Minecraft </em>for the Xbox Series X / S consoles at some point, though.</p><p id=\"Aydzim\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23001181/minecraft-raytracing-xbox-series-x-series-s-preview-support\">We tested out the ray-tracing support</a> in the <em>Minecraft </em>Preview build, and it was clearly early unoptimized code that required separate packs and workarounds to work fully. Ray tracing is currently only <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163539/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing-windows-released\">available on <em>Minecraft </em>for Windows</a>, and it’s boosted by Nvidia’s DLSS upscaling to improve frame rates. Microsoft could be aiming to incorporate <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22993152/amd-fsr-2-0-xbox-nvidia-gpus\">AMD’s FSR 2.0 Xbox support</a> to improve <em>Minecraft </em>ray tracing frame rates on Xbox Series X / S, but don’t expect to see this appear any time soon.</p>",
