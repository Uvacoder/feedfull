Fully charged, it has enough juice to charge a laptop about 16 times, run a projector for 24 hours, or power an electric BBQ for about 100 minutes. It has eight outlets: three AC, two 18W QuickCharge 3.0 USB-A, two 100W USB-C PD, and one 12V / 10A car jack. It weighs 43 pounds and measures 15.12 x 10.59 x 12.11 inches.</p><p id=\"1VNwOC\">The SolarSaga panels are made with highly efficient monocrystalline solar cells and come fitted with kickstands and handles. They deliver 200W per panel and daisy-chain directly into the DC input of the power station. Each panel weighs 18.3 pounds and measures 21.3 x 91.3 x 1 inches, which can be folded down to 21.3 x 24.2 x 12 inches and inserted into a protective carrying case.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wIlQ-jclJPYApeN5EC6JawnwNRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23442033/p.jpeg\">      <cite>Image: Jackery</cite>      <figcaption><em>Maybe they should move the panels into the sun to avoid an input reading of zero watts on the display.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"btDSsj\">In total, that’s over 150 pounds of gear to haul into the outdoors if you’re bringing all six panels and cables. Then again, this generator doesn’t require oil or a fuel tank (and reserves) and doesn’t pump harmful gases into the atmosphere.</p><p id=\"08zGdo\">Jackery says its “industry-leading charging efficiency” allows the combined 1200 watts collected from its six solar panels to charge the power station from zero to 100 percent in just 2.5 hours of sunlight. That’s remarkably fast, but you'll be  lucky to achieve that speed with the imperfect sunlight you’ll find in real-world usage. Otherwise, it can charge in two hours off an AC outlet or 24 hours from a car outlet.</p><div><div class=\"c-image-grid\"><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IQJ4jqIetEbxT_V3iY6eO09tlP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23442031/p.jpeg\">      <cite>Image: Jackery</cite>      <figcaption><em>Routing all that solar power into the battery.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y-HffvHzJzHvfaNVVsgZY4pNHng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23442030/p.jpeg\">      <cite>Image: Jackery</cite>      <figcaption><em>The solar panels fold for easier transport.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div></div></div><p id=\"v3Q4pJ\">The take-it-anywhere power trend got a boost with an uptick in #vanlifers and casual campers during the lockdown days of the pandemic. The category is now burgeoning with competitors.
