If the first trailer is anything to go by, it looks like the movie will be something of a dark comedy, jumping back and forth between goofy and grim. Hemsworth looks particularly manic, even joking about how beautiful he is. Plus, there’s lots of blood to clean up.</p><p id=\"10ZNyq\">And with new seasons of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/18/23031238/netflix-love-death-and-robots-third-season-volume-release-date\"><em>Love, Death, and Robots</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/16/23074786/black-mirror-season-six-netflix-charlie-brooker\"><em>Black Mirror</em></a> also on the way, it appears that Netflix is really cornering the market on dystopic sci-fi.</p><p id=\"5C0k0S\"><em>Spiderhead </em>hits Netflix on June 17th.</p>",
