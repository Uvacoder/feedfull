I was surprised to find their summon sign last night and even more delighted that they hadn’t been quickly summoned by numerous other players who’d read all about their skills (they wear next to nothing for protection, and they wield two katanas). They arrived in my game, and it was like seeing a celebrity. They even waved. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5aDv57yx-rw?t=51\">I used my prattling pate</a> and said, “You’re beautiful.” We walked into the battlefield together.</p><aside id=\"nX4Rgd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"All hail Elden Ring’s ever-growing map\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009950/elden-ring-giant-map-game-design-from-software\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"MX9pYq\">I was so excited to have “Let me solo her” in my game that I, in fact, did not let them solo her. Like Bizarro in <em>Sealab 2021</em>, I thought <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iExgnVXSAuE\">I was helping</a> by sending a few Swarm of Flies spells into the ring. They promptly left my game mid-battle. I was almost immediately eviscerated in the game — and in real-life — knowing that I tried to duo with the solo master. They had even gestured for me to stay back. Why couldn’t I heed the warning?</p><div id=\"UHMteA\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://streamable.com/o/anshdc\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"uINM7U\">After numerous retries by myself, I stumbled upon their summon sign again, and this time, I knew to stand back and watch them masterfully take down this boss. The legend of “Let me solo her” is alive and well. Just sit, relax, and don’t try to help out.</p><div id=\"9imWPh\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://streamable.com/e/2ih7wy\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" allowfullscreen=\"\" ></iframe></div></div><p id=\"o6zmQG\"></p>",
