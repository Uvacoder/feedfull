It partnered with AOC (the accessory company, not the US representative) to Porsche-fy this high-end Agon Pro PD32M gaming monitor that’s available for preorder now and shipping in June for $1,799. Beyond the frameless 32-inch panel, which has Mini LED backlighting for better contrast and light control, its minimalist, sturdy-looking aluminum stand mimics the style of Porsche steering wheels. </p><p id=\"AmPPFc\">After looking up what Porsche steering wheels look like, I’m not exactly sold on this homage. But even so, it certainly makes for a more elegant-looking gaming monitor than most — at least from the front. Its rear is covered in RGB LED panels that light up. And as goofy as the headphone hooks on both sides may appear, it’s a feature that I wish every monitor had. I’m always looking for a place to put my headphones and headsets.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Porsche Design AOC Agon Pro PD32M\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MP2g0L4gkWeCBEeqUom5ZUNq8LQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23386832/porschedesignaoc2.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>Business in the front, party in the back.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"9jmdF5\">Beyond aesthetics, this monitor’s $1,799 price seems reasonable for the features that it offers. In addition to the Mini LED backlighting, it has a 4K 16:9 aspect ratio display with a 144Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, DisplayHDR 1400 support, and 97 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space. The spec sheet lists that it supports “AdaptiveSync,” but it isn’t clear if that’s AMD’s FreeSync or Nvidia’s G-Sync.</p><p id=\"cuncAl\">Its rear features two HDMI ports, at least one of which supports HDMI 2.1 for up to 120Hz at 4K resolution, one DisplayPort jack, four USB 3.2 Type-A ports, a headphone jack, and one USB-C port (<a href=\"https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/2acb2bf3\">this site</a> claims it supports DisplayPort video and 65W of passthrough power). It adds on a couple of extras, like two 8W speakers and a wireless controller, presumably for switching inputs and more easily navigating its on-screen display.</p><p id=\"wZrcb7\">If you want a 4K Mini LED monitor with HDMI 2.1 support for PC, Xbox Series X, and PS5, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.porsche-design.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fporsche-design-shop%2Fshop%2Felectronics%2Fcomputing%2Fnotebook%2Fp9320-porsche-design-aoc-agon-pro-pd32m&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F4%2F13%2F23023421%2Fporsche-design-aoc-agon-gaming-monitor-mini-led-4k-price-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1,799</a> doesn’t seem like the worst possible price for this thing — especially with Porsche Design attached to the product. But monitors that seem exciting and great sometimes don’t turn out that way. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22981744/apple-studio-display-5k-monitor-webcam-speakers-review\">Apple’s $1,699 5K Studio Display</a> is one example. Samsung’s Odyssey Neo G9 with Mini LED seemed incredible and turned out to be less than stellar <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv\">in our review</a>, so maybe wait for the reviews to come out before ordering this one.</p><p id=\"b38F5S\"></p><p id=\"CE3xMq\"></p>",
