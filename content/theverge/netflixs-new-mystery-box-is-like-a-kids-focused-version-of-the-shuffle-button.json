Basically, it sounds like a kids-themed take on Netflix’s “Play Something” button, and it seems to take inspiration from the very popular trend of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14031288/ryan-toys-review-biggest-youngest-youtube-star-millions\">unwrapping toys</a>.</p><p id=\"zxFo0A\">On “TVs around the world,” Netflix will add a sparkly icon with a question mark in the favorites row of a kid’s profile, <a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/surprise-delight-and-discover-your-next-favorite-with-the-new-kids-mystery\">according to a blog post</a> about the feature. “Hover over the sparkly ‘mystery box’ to discover a title that is ‘new for you’! And voila, it’s showtime,” TJ Marston, Netflix’s director of product innovation for kids and family, said in the post.</p><p id=\"06dN8q\">Netflix has steadily been investing in the version of its service for kids with things like a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381917/netflix-kids-profile-design-favorites-row-on-screen-characters\">profile redesign</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576252/netflix-kids-features-top-10\">Top 10 row for age-restricted profiles</a>, and even a test of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771727/netflix-kids-clips-tiktok-feed-fast-laughs-ios-app\">a TikTok-style feed for kids</a>. The company has also made some big bets on kids-focused content, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22688734/netflix-roald-dahl-deal-kids-programming-competition-disney-plus\">buying the rights to Roald Dahl’s catalog</a>, though <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/news/netflix-animated-series-wings-of-fire-antiracist-baby-1235269747/\"><em>Variety</em> reports</a> Netflix recently scrapped several animated projects in the works. </p><p id=\"e4jEYZ\">The new mystery box feature could help kids find something new among the vast number of kids-focused titles on Netflix, much like the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407467/netflix-play-something-shuffle-feature-launch-tv-movie\">“Play Something” button</a> is supposed to help adults discover new content.</p><p id=\"G9pLvM\">In its last earnings call, Netflix reported that it lost subscribers for the first time <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23032399/netflix-lost-subscribers-q1-2022-earnings\">in over a decade</a>. After laying off workers from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23047113/netflix-tudum-editorial-layoffs-streaming\">its Tudum fansite in April</a>, Netflix announced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/17/23103131/netflix-layoffs-tudum-streaming-subscriber-loss-email\">additional layoffs</a> of 150 employees and dozens of contractors this week.</p>",
