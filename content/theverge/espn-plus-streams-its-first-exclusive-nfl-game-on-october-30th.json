The deal between the NFL and Disney included one international game that will be exclusive to ESPN Plus streaming, starting with the 2022 season, and <a href=\"https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2022/05/espns-2022-nfl-international-games-first-ever-espn-exclusive-game-set-for-london-and-monday-night-football-returns-to-mexico-city/\">now they’ve announced</a> that game will be the Broncos vs. Jaguars matchup in London on October 30th.</p><p id=\"b6o1CU\">The ESPN Plus exclusive game is going to be an annual occurrence through 2033, but since it’s restricted to an international match, a 9AM game with the Jaguars playing looks like less of a draw for Disney’s streaming bundle than anything Star Wars or Marvel-related. </p><div id=\"Lb1jlv\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">  Just Announced   <br><br>  The first-ever <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNPlus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ESPNPlus</a> exclusive NFL game <a href=\"https://t.co/RV10VMif2X\">pic.twitter.com/RV10VMif2X</a></p>— ESPN PR (@ESPNPR) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESPNPR/status/1521822777346609152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 4, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"xHezpT\">However, there is one thing that could change the potential of sports streaming more quickly than the development of Trevor Lawrence as a quarterback: gambling.</p><p id=\"AM7QtX\">Disney CEO Bob Chapek has openly identified sports betting (along with gaming and, uh, the metaverse) <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22926245/disney-espn-sports-streaming-betting-metaverse\">as an opportunity for Disney</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1449078593418678275\">a report last year from CNBC</a> indicated it could be a way to build the value of ESPN Plus. That’s particularly interesting because while a traditional NFL schedule release event is planned for ESPN2 on May 12th at 8PM ET, on ESPN Plus the company plans to air <em>Between the Lines</em>, with breakdowns of the schedule from its sports betting show <em>Daily Wager</em>, as well as fantasy football commentators.</p><aside id=\"llqzww\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Betting is the next battleground in sports streaming \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22822590/sports-betting-streaming-wars-disney-dazn-fubo-tv-sling\"}]}'></div></aside>",
