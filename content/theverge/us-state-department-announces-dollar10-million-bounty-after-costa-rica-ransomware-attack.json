Rodrigo Chaves Robles, Costa Rica’s recently sworn-in president, <a href=\"https://www.ameliarueda.com/nota/costa-rica-en-emergencia-nacional-por-ciberataques-noticias-costa-rica\">declared a national emergency</a> due to the attack, <a href=\"https://www.cyberscoop.com/conti-costa-rica-ransomware-peru-unc1756/\">according to <em>CyberScoop</em></a>.</p><p id=\"MGiAkN\"><a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/costa-rica-declares-national-emergency-after-conti-ransomware-attacks/\">According to <em>BleepingComputer</em></a>, the ransomware attack affected Costa Rica’s ministries of finance and Labor and Social Security, as well as the country’s Social Development and Family Allowances Fund, among other entities. The report also says that the attack affected some services from the country’s treasury starting on April 18th. Hackers not only took down some of the government’s systems, but they’re also leaking data, according to <em>CyberScoop</em>, which notes that almost 700GB of data has made its way onto Conti’s site.</p><div class=\"c-float-left\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"The Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) Offers  Rewards of up to $10,000,000 United States dollars for Information Leading to the Identification or Location of key leaders, and up to $5,000,000 United States dollars for Information Leading to the Arrest, and/or Conviction of the Owners/Operators/A...

The US government is also offering $5 million for information “leading to the arrest and/or conviction of any individual in any country conspiring to participate in or attempting to participate” in a Conti-based ransomware attack. </p><p id=\"66GwZv\">Last year, the US offered similar bounties on REvil and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22764987/darkside-hackers-bounty-10-million-colonial-pipeline\">DarkSide</a> (the group behind the Colonial Pipeline attack). REvil is largely thought to be defunct after the US <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740239/revil-ransomware-hacking-fbi-cyber-command-secret-service-down\">reportedly hacked the group’s servers</a> and the Russian government <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22883675/russia-fsb-revil-hacker-group-ransomware-us-request-fbi-doj\">claimed to have arrested several members</a>.</p><aside id=\"Bpi6p5\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Winning the war on ransomware\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22822884/us-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"PnAPgZ\">The Costa Rican government isn’t the only entity to fall victim to Conti’s ransomware. <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/04/contis-ransomware-toll-on-the-healthcare-industry/\">As <em>Krebs On Security</em> notes</a>, the group is particularly infamous for targeting healthcare facilities such as hospitals and research centers.</p><p id=\"NtInyp\">The gang is also known for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22955246/conti-ransomware-russia-ukraine-chat-logs-leaked\">having its chat logs leaked</a> after it declared that it fully supported Russia’s government shortly after the invasion of Ukraine began. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/14/conti-ransomware-leak-shows-group-operates-like-normal-tech-company.html\">According to CNBC</a>, those logs showed that the group behind the ransomware itself was having organizational issues — people weren’t getting paid, and there were arrests happening. However, like many ransomware operators, the actual software was also used by “affiliates,” or other entities who used it to carry out their own attacks.</p><p id=\"6TO8TQ\">In Costa Rica’s case, the attacker claims to be one of these affiliates and says that they aren’t part of a larger team or government, according to a message <a href=\"https://www.cyberscoop.com/conti-costa-rica-ransomware-peru-unc1756/\">posted by <em>CyberScoop</em></a>. They have, however, threatened to carry out “more serious” attacks, calling Costa Rica a “demo version.”</p>",
