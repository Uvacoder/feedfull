In stark terms, the company reports that it only has enough cash to last another quarter and is unsure whether it will be able to stay afloat beyond that. </p><p id=\"XNY9ds\">“As of the date of this announcement, we are reporting that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” the company states in its first-quarter earnings report. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"FJnDyV\"><q>“there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern”</q></aside></div><p id=\"yiYvt8\">Canoo was founded in late 2017 when former BMW executive Stefan Krause left then-struggling EV startup Faraday Future. Krause and some of the other executives who co-founded Canoo — which was then called Evelozcity — were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/29/16947846/faraday-future-lawsuit-trade-secrets-stefan-krause-evelozcity\">sued by Faraday Future for poaching employees and allegedly stealing trade secrets</a>, though the lawsuit was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1072966577660854272\">settled in late 2018</a>. </p><p id=\"orYukI\">The automaker has several EVs in the works, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440287/canoo-electric-van-price-deposit-pickup-truck\">the MPDV</a>, a multi-purpose delivery van, and the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324096/canoo-goev-ev-pickup-truck-specs-photos-revealed\">Canoo Pickup Truck</a>. The toyish truck showed just how far Canoo is willing to push the design of the microbus-style vehicle <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882538/canoo-evelozcity-ev-subsicrption-electric-vehicle\">it first debuted back in 2019</a>, which it originally planned to sell on a subscription-only basis.</p><p id=\"973wxi\">The company says it has $104.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31st. Canoo lost $125.4 million over the last three months, compared to a loss of $15.2 million in the first quarter of 2021. </p><p id=\"Lk7tEO\">In a statement, Canoo chairman and CEO Tony Aquila says the company has $600 million “in accessible capital” to support the production of its lineup of EVs. That includes $300 million in total funding via a committed PIPE from an existing shareholder and an equity purchase agreement with financing partner Yorkville Advisors, as well as a $300M universal shelf, for which Canoo has filed. </p><p id=\"KRFeYH\">The company has been <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22839732/canoo-cto-cofounders-resign-shakeup-leadership-tony-aquila\">shedding executives</a> in recent months. Last year, Canoo reported that the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections\">Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating</a> the company’s merger with a special acquisition company. And this week, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/ev-startup-canoo-sues-major-investor-over-sketchy-share-sales/\">Canoo filed a lawsuit</a> to recoup profits made by a significant investor with ties to China. </p>",
