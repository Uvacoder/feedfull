Despite previewing a full range of colors, it only released the black and red options to start. It also rolled out blue, pink, and purple DualSense controllers (in addition to the black and red controllers it already has), which will finally have matching console covers coming this summer. </p><p id=\"I7XRG1\">The PlayStation covers are <a href=\"https://youtu.be/CKeu3RzAPcE\">pretty easy to pop off and replace</a>. Adding a new color can <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22912963/ps5-console-covers-swappable-colors-price-playstation-5\">give your console a more personal touch</a> if you’re tired of the standard white-and-black look. Plus, you can mix and match them if you’d like (but with a $54.99 price tag per cover, customization doesn’t come that cheap).</p><p id=\"reM539\">Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action\">Sony threatened legal action against Dbrand</a> after it released its third-party <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306874/dbrand-ps5-darkplates-matte-black-hands-on-review\">matte black PS5 console covers</a> ahead of Sony’s own release, citing design infringement.
