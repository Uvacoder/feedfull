This model uses an older processor, but the 13-inch device is still an excellent value for anyone who is in the market for a versatile, ultraportable laptop. This particular configuration comes with an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and an impressive array of ports, including a single Thunderbolt 4 connection for docking.

As an added bonus, anyone who preorders a renewed S21 device through Samsung will receive an additional $100 credit that’s good toward a future purchase at Samsung. Note that any preorders placed today are slated to arrive by April 22nd.</p><p id=\"TzRxuD\">As far as pricing goes, the standard S21 initially retailed for $800, but is now discounted at Samsung to $675. The S21 Plus and Ultra models, meanwhile, are now on sale for $850 ($150 off) and $1,000 ($200 off), respectively. The current promo makes for an excellent collection of discounts, but if you have an eligible device to trade in, you can also knock up to an additional $450 off your purchase.

However, keep in mind that the 13-inch MacBook Pro is relatively light on port selection and the only model in Apple’s current lineup that still features the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">divisive Touch Bar</a>, which, for better or worse, does away with the classic function keys. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"eww34a\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10872846\"></div></div><p id=\"icYvjs\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856151/amd-ryzen-7000-desktop-cpu-5nm-next-gen-zen-4-release-date-ces-2022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AMD recently announced its Zen 3 CPUs</a>, and they’ve been incredibly difficult to find in-stock. But today, a pair of the most powerful models from this generation of gaming CPUs are currently on sale at multiple retailers, including Amazon, Walmart, and B&amp;H Photo. </p><p id=\"rRUw5c\">The Ryzen 9 5950X, which initially sold for $799.99 upon its release, is currently discounted to $559.99 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0815Y8J9N/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1598372-REG%2Famd_100_100000059wof_ryzen_9_5950x_3_4.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F4%2F16%2F23025037%2Fsatechi-accessories-samsung-galaxy-book-pro-s21-plus-ultra-macbook-pro-13-amd-ryzen-cpu-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, a substantial discount on the 16-core CPU. It’s outfitted with 32 threads and a maximum boost speed of 4.9GHz, and just like the previous generation of AMD CPUs, it’s compatible with motherboards equipped with an AM4 socket. </p><p id=\"7YkhFB\">If you’re looking for a cheaper model with a slightly lower performance ceiling, the Ryzen 9 5900X is also on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5900X-24-Thread-Processor/dp/B08164VTWH?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAMD-Ryzen-9-5900X-12-core-24-thread-Desktop-Processor%2F647899167%3F&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup041522\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> for $384.99 ($185 off), the lowest price we’ve seen on the CPU to date. The 5900X is equipped with 12 cores and 24 threads of processing power, as well as a maximum clock speed of 4.8Ghz, which ensures it still has more than enough power for modern gaming.</p><p id=\"1R0nTC\">Both of these processors are an excellent deal, especially for anyone upgrading from an existing AMD-based desktop. Just note, that unlike AMD’s previous generation of processors, these CPUs don’t come packaged with their own coolers.</p><div id=\"F6HbqJ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11146045\"></div></div><div id=\"FVN3NO\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11146042\"></div></div><aside id=\"ugz1Ub\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside><p id=\"iVpQQ4\"></p><p id=\"hQUYaq\"></p><p id=\"FvN6rx\"></p><p id=\"v5vBht\"></p><p id=\"IA8iIh\"></p><p id=\"eNSg94\"></p><p id=\"rVWe83\"></p>",
