He has worn a lot of hats in the past decade: reviewing products, running the newsroom, training and editing new writers, putting spicy editorials on the site, starring in a few videos, liveblogging, and shaping coverage where he can. He’s currently a Senior Editor.  </p><p id=\"LhTLLz\"><strong>Tell us a little about yourself.  What do you like doing at </strong><em><strong>The Verge</strong></em><strong>?</strong></p><p id=\"YZ5X3A\">My favorite part of the job is blogging about gadgets! I try to do it every day no matter what else <em>The Verge</em> needs from me because I love them to death. </p><p id=\"3BN44L\"><strong>Where did you get your desk and where in your home have you placed it?</strong></p><p id=\"q1s6G6\">It’s in the corner of my home office, right beneath a mini-split air conditioner, so I can usually dial in a comfortable temperature even if my gaming PC pumps out a bit too much heat. And yes, it pulls double duty as my battlestation — note <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23005435/magic-mouse-apple-logitech-powerplay\">the gaming mouse</a>, Razer <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B07FFCN3DJ?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BlackWidow Elite keyboard</a>, and the Xbox 360 controller hiding under the right monitor! Out of frame, there’s a big display case where my wife and I keep our <a href=\"https://www.figma.jp/en/figma/\">Figma</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F23037594%2Fsean-hollister-desk-razer-synology-microsoft\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lego</a> collections, and her desk is across the room. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Three monitors sit atop a Fully Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vx2dv73kCNddkWCBKnanKf2fkAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418343/shollister_220418_5169_0009.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>Three monitors sit atop a Fully Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"7Kyrlp\">My desk is a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fjarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F23037594%2Fsean-hollister-desk-razer-synology-microsoft\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fully Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk</a>, one that’s proven pretty popular among <em>Verge</em> staffers, but that’s not why I bought it; my wife got one first, and I’ve been jealous ever since. Originally, I had the comparatively terrible <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fbekant-desk-sit-stand-white-s49022538%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F23037594%2Fsean-hollister-desk-razer-synology-microsoft\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ikea Bekant</a>, a purchase I’ve regretted for years. The Jarvis is <em>so</em> much smoother, steadier, quieter, and — importantly, I’ve found — raises and lowers to my preferred height(s) with a single press, giving me no excuse to sit around all day and ignore the standing feature like the lazy bum I am.</p><p id=\"2Z2sEe\">Other brands make very, very similar desks, some of them based on the same parts, but I’ve also had the two best customer support experiences of my life with Fully. If I were doing it again, though, I’d buy the 60-inch version so I’d have a bit more room for an add-on drawer.</p><div id=\"6As22i\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10306098\"></div></div><p id=\"m3SGNV\"><strong>Tell us about your chair.</strong></p><p id=\"CUsKeU\">It’s a 20-year-old <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hermanmiller.com%2Foffice-chairs-aeron%2Faeron-chair%2F2195348.html%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F23037594%2Fsean-hollister-desk-razer-synology-microsoft\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Herman Miller Aeron</a> that’s still going strong, a hand-me-down. I’m at least the third owner, maybe the fourth? I told myself I’d never buy an ugly Aeron, and now, of course, I can’t imagine using anything else. I tried a whole bunch of chairs, actually, but the Aeron seatpan’s supportive bounce can’t be beat. I do need to replace the tube one of these years: it sometimes makes a worrying <em>clunk</em> when I sit down.</p><p id=\"YJWOZc\">I did make a couple upgrades, though! I love a good headrest, and while Herman Miller doesn’t make one, <a href=\"https://atlasheadrest.com/products/atlas-cushion-headrest-for-herman-miller-aeron-chair\">the third-party Atlas Headrest</a> is the best $160 I’ve spent in years. I can’t vouch for their current models, but the old cushion version I have is incredibly easy to adjust and wonderfully supportive whether I’m upright or leaning back. I also replaced the old lumbar cushion with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Herman-Miller-Classic-PostureFit-Graphite/dp/B000LT6BFS?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the adjustable PostureFit lumbar kit</a>, which is… fine, I guess. Modern Aerons have a stronger version that’s built right in.</p><p id=\"ho8zwT\"><strong>Okay, here’s the long one: tell us about the tech that you’re using. </strong></p><p id=\"FVdLAL\">You’re actually seeing a pretty clean version of my desk! It’s usually strewn with whatever tech I’m testing, and you’ll probably notice I’ve got quite a few microSD cards that I’ve been using for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22960536/steam-deck-faq-valve-one-month-later\">my ongoing Steam Deck review</a>. </p><p id=\"ExfoQw\">But even without the extra clutter, my triple-monitor array doesn’t leave a lot of space on a 48-inch desk. It’s a good thing my custom desktop gaming PC only takes up 12.7 liters: it’s an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725010/ncase-m1-pc-case-sff-small-form-factor-discontinued\">Ncase M1</a> with a Ryzen 5 5600X, a 240mm closed-loop cooler, a GeForce RTX 3060 Ti FE, 32 gigs of RAM, four SSDs, and a slot-loading Blu-ray drive. </p><div><div class=\"c-image-grid\"><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"An NAS offers long-term storage.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEodqyGmx0xy7-jpA2fxyYp_KQI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418339/shollister_220418_5169_0005.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>An NAS offers long-term storage.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Small speakers offer great audio quality.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QuBDpmulSvjLI4RUyL1QTExWhx0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418337/shollister_220418_5169_0003.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>Small speakers offer great audio quality.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div></div></div><p id=\"3MT4E4\">Next to that, I’ve got a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570609-REG%2Fsynology_diskstation_ds920_4_bay_nas.html%2F%3F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F23037594%2Fsean-hollister-desk-razer-synology-microsoft\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Synology DS920 Plus</a> for long-term storage and streaming my video collection to Plex — though I only have it set to boot on the weekends since I don’t really access it that often. Flanking the PC and NAS are my cherry red <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Audioengine-A2-Wireless-Bluetooth-Amplifier/dp/B07P5PTP32?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Audioengine A2 Plus speakers</a>, which I adore because they’re tiny, support USB <em>and</em> analog <em>and</em> Bluetooth, and their audio quality punches way above their size and weight — though the bass is a little lacking, I suppose. I spend a bunch of my day in headphones anyhow, but it’s refreshing to take them off and enjoy higher-quality audio (and hopefully avoid missing Slack pings).</p><div id=\"WvdsTs\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11156648\"></div></div><p id=\"OtGEZy\">Speaking of headphones, I swear by the SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless… except <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22643754/steelseries-arctis-pro-wireless-power-button-battery-swap\">when I’m swearing <em>at</em> it when it’s time to swap batteries</a>. Otherwise, it’s a fantastic wireless headset with long range and individual channels for gaming and chat on PC, and I enjoy having its OLED-equipped base station on my desk. (Though I usually control the headset using its own built-in dial instead.) I hang the headset from the hook on the bottom of my mic stand. </p><p id=\"MjQwXg\">Oh, and when it’s time for some <em>Duck Game</em> or <em>SpeedRunners</em> or <em>Elden Ring</em>, I always keep my old Xbox 360 gamepad and Wireless Receiver for Windows handy! <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22244488/gaming-gear-recommendations-favorite-nintendo-logitech-microsoft\">I’ve written about the receiver before</a>, and the official Microsoft one is worth its weight in gold.  </p><p id=\"pZ25vt\"><strong>You’ve managed to fit a lot of tech on that desk, including some fairly large displays. How did you manage it?</strong></p><p id=\"1RXWmx\">The trick is keeping the monitors off the table. I tend to be a cheapskate — almost everything on my desk (and the desk itself) was hand-me-down or bought on sale. But my favorite bargain finds are my Doc Ock monitor arms — the Dell MSA14, which office liquidators used to sell as low as $50 on Craigslist or eBay. The Dell U2412M monitors atop them were Craigslist finds, too, and they’re now literally a decade old, but their 24-inch, 16:10 screens are perfect for tossing up TweetDeck and Slack and Evernote and the occasional YouTube video while I work or play.</p><p id=\"8chX9Y\">My main screen is an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Gaming-VG27AQ-G-SYNC-Monitor/dp/B07WQ4FXY9?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Asus VG27AQ</a>. One of the biggest reasons I bought it was its small, squarish stand. That way, it can perch atop my NAS at the perfect head height with just enough room for my mini desktop and water bottle underneath. Too many modern monitors have big V-shaped stands that make them hard to prop up, I’m afraid.</p><div><div class=\"c-image-grid\"><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Sometimes you want to swap the speakers for a pair of headphones.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lo0UvMj7zR7kt_kO-mlpzHw8SAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418335/shollister_220418_5169_0001.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>Sometimes you want to swap the speakers for a pair of headphones.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"A drawer holds screwdrivers, USB-C gear and other gadgets.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOrkc_YHcuoRg7ORXz11h3pS2LU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418342/shollister_220418_5169_0008.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>A drawer holds screwdrivers, USB-C gear, and other gadgets.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div></div></div><p id=\"P7X96W\"><strong>What do you keep in that single drawer?

Maybe if I sand off the corner where I keep bumping my knee and find a way to get it to open smoothly… </p><p id=\"fFALBN\"><strong>Most boom arms I’ve seen on desks hold mics — but yours holds a smartphone…?</strong></p><p id=\"jrI8kS\">Yeah, I totally stole inspiration from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21572162/remote-work-desk-home-set-up-writer-gamer-logitech-asus\">Taylor Lyles’ What’s on your Desk</a> by buying the same <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-TONOR-Adjustable-Suspension-T20/dp/B082W4B7SX?ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD&amp;ots=1&amp;slotNum=15&amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tonor mic stand</a>, and a good friend who used to work for <em>Polygon</em> recommended the wonderful <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Blackout-Condenser-Recording-Streaming/dp/B074379C7Q?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Spark XLR mic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Icicle-Microphone-Converter/dp/B001EW5YQS?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Icicle XLR-to-USB adapter</a> that typically hangs from it. But recently, I’ve been thinking a lot more about quick videos than podcasts or voiceover, and the boom looked like a good hands-free way to film a few things.

I’ve had a rat’s nest under my desk for ages, and I’ve tried a number of cord keepers and wraps before… but this year I stumbled onto <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089B7VLX5?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">these privacy panels</a> with built-in pockets for cables. They’re not perfect — this one relies on velcro strips that I’m pretty sure will give out over time, but it lets me hide a lot of the mess and also holds my ethernet switch and an Intel NUC where I’m running Home Assistant. The monitor arms have some built-in cable management, too, which helps, and so do the grommets on the desk, and I like having a power strip with rotating outlets (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-8-Outlet-Pivot-Plug-Power-Protector/dp/B000JE9LCK?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this is mine</a>) so you can point them out of the way.</p><div><div class=\"c-image-grid\"><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"These privacy panels have built in pockets for cables.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6yVqfmc9QwvvHHxu77VOqcJcjp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418336/shollister_220418_5169_0002.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>These privacy panels have built-in pockets for cables.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"A view from underneath the desk shows the hidden storage.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n_fWO7JQ9QFxVy0L76QfW-AwLlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23418344/shollister_220418_5169_0010.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>A view from underneath the desk shows the hidden storage.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div></div></div><p id=\"vWyaym\">That whole power strip plugs right into <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tripp-Lite-Battery-Rack-Mount-SMART1500LCD/dp/B000DZRY9C?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a Tripp Lite uninterruptible power supply</a>, by the way  — a hand-me-down from a friend with way too much gear on his hands.

It’s just a nice silicone coaster that reminds me of when <em>The Verge </em>was just <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Happicamp/i-took-this-photo-ten-years-ago-five-years-later-it-changed-my-career-25986949a4ed\">16 or so people</a> with big ideas in a single room.
