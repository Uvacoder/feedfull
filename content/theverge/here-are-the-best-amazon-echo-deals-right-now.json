Even when they’re selling for full price, Amazon offers a 25 percent discount when you trade in select devices, meaning there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are on sale.</p><p id=\"g46moE\">Below, we’ve rounded up some of the better discounts available on each device in Amazon’s Echo line, some of which are currently on sale for nearly 40 percent off.</p><div id=\"aqM9kh\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:11118383\"></div></div><aside id=\"868HqZ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How to turn your Echo Show into a digital photo frame \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22982857/how-to-echo-show-amazon-digital-photo-frame\"},{\"title\":\"The best smart displays for every home\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest\"}]}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"zNwIju\">The best Echo Dot deals</h2><p id=\"maQ5h0\">Last year, Amazon released the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker\">fourth generation of the Echo Dot</a>, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot.

The device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and Show 8, the 2021 model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized, swiveling base that allows the display to follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.</p><p id=\"z9Ka9y\">We’ve seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted to as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. If you still want to pick it up, however, you can get it right now for $249.99 — the smart display’s typical retail price — at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1275355/2092?subId1=VergeBestAmazonEchoDeals030322&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa-charcoal%2F-%2FA-80770248\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>.

It’s designed to replace the likes of bulletin boards and calendars, and as such, it functions as a shared hub for families where everyone can see digital sticky notes, upcoming calendar appointments, shopping lists, and other reminders. It also features support for Alexa, meaning it offers the same functionality as other Echo displays and smart speakers, and you can even use it as a decent 1080p TV in your kitchen or to display photos and artwork. It’s even compatible with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099LF68JS/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an optional stand</a>, though, we’d argue it remains a better fit for your wall than your countertop given its size.</p><p id=\"c3Vzxa\">Having launched at the end of last year, we have yet to see any discounts on the Echo Show 15.
