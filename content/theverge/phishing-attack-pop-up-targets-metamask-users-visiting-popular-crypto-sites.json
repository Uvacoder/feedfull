As reported by <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/05/13/popular-crypto-data-sites-targeted-with-phishing-attack/\"><em>CoinDesk</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/146937/users-targeted-by-phishing-attack-via-third-party-integrations-on-crypto-data-sites\"><em>The Block Crypto</em></a>, sites including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/etherscan/status/1525233800208232448\">Etherscan</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coingecko/status/1525229832094617600\">CoinGecko</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DEXToolsApp/status/1525233641843982339\">DexTools</a> all warned users that they were aware of suspicious popups appearing for visitors, and advised them not to confirm any transactions based on popups.</p><p id=\"pgcFX5\">Like many recent phishing attacks, this one appeared to promise a link to the Bored Ape Yacht Club project, with an ape skull logo and a (now-disabled) nftapes.win domain. It prompted users to connect their MetaMask wallets (a software cryptocurrency wallet that enables access on your phone or via a browser extension) to use on the site, and since it was appearing on domains that many people trust and use every day, they may have fallen for it and given it access. </p><aside id=\"e1RQW4\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"What happens to the foot soldiers of the meme trading revolution?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23067404/meme-stocks-gamestop-crypto-sell\"},{\"title\":\"Number go down\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/9/23064269/bitcoin-sell-plunge-crypto\"},{\"title\":\"Inside the cryptocurrency scam vortex\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22522380/cryptocurrency-scams-hacks-bitcoin\"},{\"title\":\"Major exchanges delist Terra stablecoin as price collapse continues \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/13/23070853/crypto-exchanges-delist-terra-stablecoin-luna-binance\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"BnxUUc\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Update: The situation is caused by a malicious ad script by Coinzilla, a crypto ad network - we have disabled it now but there may be some delay due to CDN caching.

In February, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/20/22943228/opensea-phishing-hack-smart-contract-bug-stolen-nft\">a phishing attack stole $1.7 million</a> worth of NFTs from OpenSea users, while a more recent attempt via Discord <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/6/23059715/nft-discord-phishing-opensea-youtube\">only snagged $18,000 worth of tokens</a>.</p><p id=\"2gLXDP\">Etherscan said it has disabled third-party integrations for the time being.
