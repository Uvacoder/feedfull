The agency said the X option will be available for other forms of documentation next year, according to a statement from Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p><p id=\"JHYDVp\">“After thoughtful consideration of the research conducted and feedback from community members, we concluded that the definition of the X gender marker on State Department public forms will be ‘Unspecified or another gender identity,’” Blinken said. “This definition is respectful of individuals’ privacy while advancing inclusion.”</p><p id=\"KakSWZ\">The State Department first <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/us-add-third-gender-option-american-passports-rcna1314\">said last June</a> that it would add a third gender marker to passports, but it didn’t provide a date when the change would take effect. It also announced that it would allow passport applicants to self-select their gender, without requiring medical evidence in cases where their gender did not match what was listed on other identification. </p><p id=\"BoiS3s\">The Human Rights Campaign <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/human-rights-campaign-applauds-biden-harris-administrations-actions-on-transgender-day-of-visibility\">applauded the decision</a>. HRC interim president Joni Madison said the update was one of several policy updates by the Biden administration “that will improve the lives of transgender and non-binary people in this country.”</p><p id=\"YNyYgc\">The news comes on Transgender Day of Visibility, at a time when several state legislatures have taken up <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/dont-say-gay-bill-anti-lgbtq-legislation-florida-idaho\">anti-transgender measures</a> to try to prevent transgender children from receiving gender-affirming healthcare or playing on sports teams. A <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/31/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-advances-equality-and-visibility-for-transgender-americans/\">statement from the White House on Thursday condemned</a> “the proliferation of dangerous anti-transgender legislative attacks,” adding that “the evidence is clear that these types of bills stigmatize and worsen the well-being and mental health of transgender kids, and they put loving and supportive families across the country at risk of discrimination and harassment.”</p><p id=\"oPyRUl\">For details on how to apply for a passport with the X marker, visit <a href=\"https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjAzMzEuNTU3MDg3NTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RyYXZlbC5zdGF0ZS5nb3YvY29udGVudC90cmF2ZWwvZW4vcGFzc3BvcnRzL25lZWQtcGFzc3BvcnQvc2VsZWN0aW5nLXlvdXItZ2VuZGVyLW1hcmtlci5odG1sIn0.IBAh3HOeulMsVmqSiQmlLVKflj3govDxhXnO5i7-5xw/s/1366013323/br/128932031562-l\">travel.state.gov/gender</a>.</p><p id=\"gLNOBz\"></p><p id=\"xQvJHm\"></p>",
