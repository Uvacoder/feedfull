Many manufacturers — including LG and Samsung — announced new versions of some of their most popular models during the event, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858577/samsung-frame-2022-tv-matte-antireflective-screen\">The Frame</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features\">LG’s new C2 lineup</a>. That means we’re probably going to start seeing prices fall on last-gen models as newer models become available throughout the rest of the year.</p><p id=\"DOJ1Fo\">For those looking to pick up a solid deal before the new models arrive, however, fret not, as there are still some great discounts available. There are currently a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, size configurations, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories.</p><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"E3xT2B\"><h2 id=\"PBNYtv\">Select a category</h2><ul><li id=\"tf9rXR\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#f9MF2Z\">The best 4K TV deals for most people</a></li><li id=\"eeM2RN\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#EYhbja\">The best TV deals on a budget</a></li><li id=\"vzRoT0\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#qm44jO\">The best deals on OLED TVs</a></li><li id=\"mlO4U5\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#O5Vjam\">The best deals for 4K TVs for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X</a></li></ul><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"1I1ma7\"><div id=\"VMiVmn\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10971155\"></div></div><h2 id=\"f9MF2Z\">The best 4K TV deals for most people</h2><h3 id=\"etpdeM\">Sony X80J</h3><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"4cwOJ9\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:11051506\"></div></div></div><p id=\"cart-6484511\">Sony’s 55-inch X80J TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast.

When turned on, however, it transforms into an HDR-compatible QLED TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and support for AirPlay 2. The stylish, 4K TV also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, access to all the popular streaming services, and four HDMI ports.</p><p id=\"e6EGPx\">While we’ve previously saw the 55-inch drop to an all-time low of $998 during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, right now you can only buy the model for around $1,398 ($100 off) at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1620610-REG%2Fsamsung_qn55ls03aafxza_the_frame_ls03a_55.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cfLCWIlxESJ\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-55-34-the-frame-smart-4k-uhd-tv-qn55ls03a-black%2F-%2FA-82065397&amp;subid1=TheVergeBestTVDealsFeb162022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgEo9n3OQX2\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a>.</p><div id=\"lOmRWq\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10819823\"></div></div><aside id=\"oFag7e\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Samsung’s latest Frame TVs have a matte screen that looks and feels more like real art\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858577/samsung-frame-2022-tv-matte-antireflective-screen\"},{\"title\":\"Samsung’s 2022 TV lineup has big software changes, smaller hardware upgrades\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863489/samsung-2022-neo-qled-8k-4k-tvs-announced-features\"}]}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"EYhbja\">The best TV deals on a budget</h2><h3 id=\"UmMHNt\">Insignia’s 4K HDR Fire TV Edition</h3><p id=\"zWYgij\">You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a 4K TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s F30 Series Fire TV is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other features. </p><p id=\"UoTDK2\">At the moment, the 4K smart TV is on sale in all size configurations, including the 55-inch model, which you can buy for $349.99 ($100 off) at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1748188127423432886\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> (via the Best Buy storefront).

As the name might imply, the 4K LED TV allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV.

That’s nearly a 50 percent discount and cheaper than buying the 65-inch TV, which currently <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Flg-oled65gxpua-oled-4k-tv&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">retails for $3,499.99</a>.</p><div id=\"lpiA85\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10445785\"></div></div><h3 id=\"nGYSCL\">Vizio OLED</h3><p id=\"gKhcwu\">Vizio’s 4K OLED offering is one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for a budget-friendly OLED TV. The manufacturer doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, sure, but its 55-inch model remains a worthwhile option to consider if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X. </p><p id=\"p0PUsY\">Vizio’s 55-inch OLED can often be found on sale for around $1,000. Right now, however, it’s only available at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgooPl8Oqdb\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vizio.com%2Fen%2Ftv%2Foled%2FOLED55-H1&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vizio</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-55-Inch-Premium-Refresh-Chromecast/dp/B09JYN63B5/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> for $1,199.99, which is $100 off the suggested retail price.</p><div id=\"s1Jrht\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10462603\"></div></div><h2 id=\"O5Vjam\">4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X </h2><p id=\"xr7I2E\">Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations</a>. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.</p><h2 id=\"gdxA6x\">LG C1 OLED</h2><p id=\"qapHVJ\">If you’re looking for an impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.</p><p id=\"WI5bxi\">Throughout the holidays, we saw the 55-inch C1 selling for around $1,297 instead of $1,499.99, its lowest price to date. That deal is once again available at a variety of retailers,  including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1632396-REG%2Flg_oled55c1pub_c1pu_55_class_hdr.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flg-55-34-class-4k-uhd-smart-oled-hdr-tv-oled55c1%2F-%2FA-82219821%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtmnv%26DFA%3D71700000090829632%26CPNG%3DPLA_DVM%252Ba064R000011tbUVQAY-LG_TaxTime_FY22_Flight-580867%26adgroup%3DPLA_TaxTime%26LID%3D700000001393753pgs%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9031583%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiA3rKQBhCNARIsACUEW_YgnEe19dXDDL0pC1R3-PqKsBvGRQa0EP7FIgt6vMpf67FWKuInWhoaAsSKEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;subid1=TheVergeBestTVDealsFeb162022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cguK5D5nEGT\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Flg-oled55c1pub-oled-4k-tv&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LG</a>, most of which are also throwing in a six-month subscription to Nvidia GeForce Now Priority.

Unlike the LG models above, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung’s most recent flagship</a> uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.</p><p id=\"TYqOuE\">During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the 55-inch QN90A sold for just shy of $1,300, which remains its lowest price to date. It has once again returned to that price, selling for around $1,299.99 at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1748274080574733405\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgvaBNNcRO7\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1620609-REG%2Fsamsung_qn50qn90aafxza_qn90a_50_class_hdr.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FSAMQN55QN90AA&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BuyDig</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>.
