As the name might imply, the 4K LED TV allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV.

Right now, however, it’s only available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-55-Inch-Premium-Refresh-Chromecast/dp/B09JYN63B5/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FVIZIO-OLED-55-Class-4K-HDR-SmartCast-Smart-TV-OLED55-H1-Newest-Model%2F664326832&amp;subid1=TheVergeBestTVDealsMarch212022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgooPl8Oqdb\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vizio.com%2Fen%2Ftv%2Foled%2FOLED55-H1&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vizio</a> for around $1,198, which is $100 off the suggested retail price.</p><div id=\"s1Jrht\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10462603\"></div></div><h2 id=\"O5Vjam\">4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X </h2><p id=\"xr7I2E\">Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of the models below. Note that, for the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.</p><h2 id=\"gdxA6x\">LG C1 OLED</h2><p id=\"qapHVJ\">If you’re looking for an impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.</p><p id=\"WI5bxi\">Throughout the holidays, we saw the 55-inch C1 selling for around $1,196.99 instead of $1,499.99, its lowest price to date. That deal is once again available at a variety of retailers,  including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1632396-REG%2Flg_oled55c1pub_c1pu_55_class_hdr.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flg-55-34-class-4k-uhd-smart-oled-hdr-tv-oled55c1%2F-%2FA-82219821%3F&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup032122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cguK5D5nEGT\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Flg-oled55c1pub-oled-4k-tv&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LG</a>.

No matter which retailer you purchase the TV from, you’ll also receive a $100 Fanatics gift card.</p><p id=\"tN6nya\">If you prefer a larger TV, discounts are available on other configurations as well.

Unlike the LG models above, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung’s most recent flagship</a> uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.</p><p id=\"TYqOuE\">During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the 55-inch QN90A sold for just shy of $1,300, which was previously its best price today. Right now, however, it’s on sale for around $1,248 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FSAMQN55QN90AA&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BuyDig</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1748274080574733405\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgvaBNNcRO7\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a>.
