Many manufacturers — including LG and Samsung — announced new versions of some of their most popular models during the event, ranging from <a href=\"https://events.release.narrativ.com/api/v0/client_redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftelevisions-home-theater%2Ftvs%2Fthe-frame%2F65-class-the-frame-qled-4k-smart-tv-2022-qn65ls03bafxza%2F%3Fnrtv_cid%3D.nrtv_plchldr.%26cid%3Dopmc-ecomm-nrtiv-tv-042720-142014-verge-10769397%26utm_source%3Dverge%26utm_medium%3Dnarrativ%26utm_campaign%3D10769397%26utm_content%3Dtv%26nrtv_as_src%3D1&amp;a=1769028219531659156&amp;uuid=ff050ddc-e754-443b-b3c6-1fad116b064c&amp;uid_bam=1750571413629784227&amp;ar=1769398194636616954\">The Frame</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features\">LG’s new C2 lineup</a>.

There are currently a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, size configurations, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories.</p><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"E3xT2B\"><h2 id=\"PBNYtv\">Select a category</h2><ul><li id=\"tf9rXR\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#f9MF2Z\">The best 4K TV deals for most people</a></li><li id=\"eeM2RN\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#EYhbja\">The best TV deals on a budget</a></li><li id=\"vzRoT0\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#qm44jO\">The best deals on OLED TVs</a></li><li id=\"mlO4U5\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#O5Vjam\">The best deals for 4K TVs for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X</a></li></ul><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"1I1ma7\"><div id=\"VMiVmn\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10971155\"></div></div><h2 id=\"f9MF2Z\">The best 4K TV deals for most people</h2><h3 id=\"etpdeM\">Sony X80J</h3><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"4cwOJ9\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:11051506\"></div></div></div><p id=\"cart-6484511\">Sony’s 55-inch X80J TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at Walmart, where you can buy the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-55-Class-KD55X80J-4K-Ultra-HD-LED-Smart-Google-TV-with-Dolby-Vision-HDR-X80J-Series-2021-model%2F919937738&amp;subid1=TheVergeBestTVDealsApril192022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">55-inch model for $598 instead of $799.99</a>.

The last-gen Roku model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mini LED backlighting</a>, which brings better brightness and contrast.

If you prefer a larger model, Amazon and Best Buy are also selling the 65-inch for $999.99 (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885N17CC/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cfLCtSSCCCU\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>), a $300 discount, and taking $500 off of the 75-inch, selling it instead for $1,299.99 (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C67986B/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cfVnwOsusm3\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>).</p><div id=\"y8BpYm\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10327662\"></div></div><aside id=\"1LlJyI\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"TCL announces new 6-series and 5-series TVs that come with Google TV instead of Roku\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs\"}]}'></div></aside><h3 id=\"9r16Zp\">TCL 5-Series (Google TV model)</h3><p id=\"title\">While the 5-Series sits below the 6-Series in TCL’s lineup, it’s also worth taking a look at if you’re on the hunt for a larger display. The latest model sports a QLED panel like the newest 6-Series, though, it lacks Mini LED backlighting and is limited to 120Hz at 1440p, whereas the 6-Series is capable of 4K at 120Hz. The newer model also uses Google TV software as opposed to the Roku software featured on the aforementioned 5-Series, which allows it to provide personalized recommendations and access to thousands of streaming apps. It’s a good buy if you want a QLED TV with vibrant colors and good contrast, but don’t want to pay the premium for the latest 6-Series. Normally $1,299.99, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg4rwOV1aiO\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/TCL-Class-Dolby-Vision-Google/dp/B09QY3334B?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon are currently selling the massive, 75-inch model for just $799.99</a>, an all-time low.</p><div id=\"Zu0kXs\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11151611\"></div></div><h2 id=\"EYhbja\">The best TV deals on a budget</h2><h3 id=\"UmMHNt\">Insignia’s 4K HDR Fire TV Edition</h3><p id=\"zWYgij\">You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a 4K TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s F30 Series Fire TV is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other features. </p><p id=\"vmmud3\">At the moment, you can buy the 65-inch version of the 4K smart TV at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgEy6XGGcVt\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08CVTKRJG/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> (via the Best Buy storefront) for $449.99, which is a $120 discount and the same price as the 55-inch version. If you prefer a smaller TV, you can also get the 50-inch model for $299.99 ($100 off) from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08Z265BJH/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg4omVcbSfX\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>.</p><div id=\"jIOPJT\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10605845\"></div></div><h3 id=\"cW4VPC\">Toshiba Smart Fire TV Edition</h3><p id=\"67O1o8\">Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 55-inch C350 Series Fire TV, which normally retails for $469.99. As the name might imply, the 4K LED TV allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. The latest models also tout an Alexa-enabled remote, an easy-to-use interface, and support for both Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10. Right now, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgoh5l0KZNF\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> is selling the 55-inch model for $379.99, a $90 discount, while <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924WG7JD/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> (by way of Best Buy) has it for $20 more. Other configurations are also on sale, including the 75-inch model, which is selling for $749.99 instead of $899.99  (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924Y49C1/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg4osBYrDxd\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>).</p><div id=\"MwFrBH\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10444802\"></div></div><h3 id=\"dOS2XD\">TCL Class 4-Series</h3><p id=\"irmzdA\">TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-Series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. You can currently get the 55-inch model for $359.99 at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgoilIi4bwL\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/TCL-Class-UHD-Smart-Roku/dp/B08GWBBH4R/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, which is $20 less than the usual retail price. </p><div id=\"HtnMEi\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9740197\"></div></div><aside id=\"6xim8b\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"TCL announces 98-inch XL QLED TV, and you can buy it today\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866323/tcl-98-inch-qled-google-tv-features-price\"}]}'></div></aside><h3 id=\"SPPi6g\">Amazon Omni Fire TV</h3><p id=\"gGh4Mn\">Amazon’s first TV, the Omni Fire 4K TV, launched in November and starts at $370. The self-branded effort features the ability to query Alexa even when the TV is off, as well as a low input lag and support for two-way video calling. We gave it a 7 out of 10 in our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">review</a>, while noting how the TV shows great promise thanks to its robust Alexa integration and support for Apple’s AirPlay 2, among other things. At the same time, however, TCL and other similarly priced television makers offer better picture quality.</p><p id=\"nj1DzI\">While we’ve recently seen the 55-inch sell for as low as $369.99, right now it’s only available for $559.99, its full retail price. However, the 65-inch model — which also offers support for Dolby Vision HDR — is currently on sale for its best price to date at Amazon, where you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6J1HG8?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pick it up for $499.99 instead of $829.99</a>.</p><div id=\"robl5C\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10848642\"></div></div><aside id=\"sH3D5N\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"You can now take Zoom calls from your Amazon television\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850298/amazon-fire-tv-omni-zoom-calls\"}]}'></div></aside><h3 id=\"JzjnIN\">Vizio M7-Series Premium Quantum</h3><p id=\"X4U9P7\">If you’re looking for a budget-friendly TV with good picture quality, Vizio’s midrange M7-Series Quantum TV is worthy of consideration. The 2021 model sports a 60Hz panel, along with support for Apple’s AirPlay 2, AMD FreeSync, and a variable refresh rate (VRR). It also touts Vizio’s SmartCast system and a built-in Chromecast, allowing you to cast content from your phone and access Netflix, Disney Plus, and all your favorite streaming services.</p><p id=\"O8hZAJ\">Right now, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094MJRG2V?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FVIZIO-55-Class-M7-Series-Premium-4K-UHD-Quantum-Color-LED-SmartCast-Smart-TV-M55Q7-J01%2F271873571%3F&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup032122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cguKCqksnZK\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> are selling the 55-inch model for around $548, which is a $200 discount.

Unlike more expensive OLEDs, however, the 4K TV doesn’t come with a slate of advanced gaming features, like those found on LG’s C1 model. It offers a slower 60Hz display and lacks HDMI 2.1, for example, and doesn’t support a variable refresh rate.</p><div id=\"cKOBk3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10596459\"></div></div><aside id=\"QVK3a0\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"LG announces its largest and smallest OLED TVs ever as part of 2022 lineup\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features\"}]}'></div></aside><h3 id=\"nGYSCL\">Vizio OLED</h3><p id=\"gKhcwu\">Vizio’s 4K OLED offering is one of the more affordable options if you’re looking for a budget-friendly OLED TV. The manufacturer doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, sure, but its 55-inch model remains a worthwhile option to consider if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X. </p><p id=\"OCTKTR\">Typically, Vizio’s 55-inch OLED can often be found on sale for around $1,000. Right now, however, it’s only available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-55-Inch-Premium-Refresh-Chromecast/dp/B09JYN63B5/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FVIZIO-OLED-55-Class-4K-HDR-SmartCast-Smart-TV-OLED55-H1-Newest-Model%2F664326832&amp;subid1=TheVergeBestTVDealsMarch212022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> for $1,056.58, which is about $143 off the suggested retail price.</p><div id=\"s1Jrht\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10462603\"></div></div><h2 id=\"O5Vjam\">4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X </h2><p id=\"xr7I2E\">Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of the models below. Note that, for the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.</p><h2 id=\"gdxA6x\">LG C1 OLED</h2><p id=\"qapHVJ\">If you’re looking for an impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.</p><p id=\"WI5bxi\">Throughout the holidays, we saw the 55-inch C1 selling for around $1,196.99 instead of $1,499.99, its lowest price to date. That deal is once again available at a variety of retailers, including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1632396-REG%2Flg_oled55c1pub_c1pu_55_class_hdr.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flg-55-34-class-4k-uhd-smart-oled-hdr-tv-oled55c1%2F-%2FA-82219821%3F&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup032122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cguK5D5nEGT\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Flg-oled55c1pub-oled-4k-tv&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LG</a>.

No matter which retailer you purchase the TV from, you’ll also <a href=\"https://entertainment.lg-promos.com/geforcenow/en-US\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">be able to claim a six-month subscription to Nvidia GeForce Now Priority</a>.</p><p id=\"tN6nya\">If you prefer a larger TV, discounts are available on other size configurations as well, with many selling at all-time lows. Right now, for instance, you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pick up the 65-inch model at Amazon for $1,696.99 ($803 off)</a>, which is its best price to date.</p><div id=\"XAV4ln\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10618444\"></div></div><h3 id=\"bn523S\">Samsung Neo QLED QN90A</h3><p id=\"PXnRvH\">For a viable OLED alternative, there’s the Neo QLED QN90A. Unlike the LG models above, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung’s most recent flagship</a> uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.</p><p id=\"TYqOuE\">During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the 55-inch QN90A sold for just shy of $1,300, which is what it’s currently going for at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FSAMQN55QN90AA&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BuyDig</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1748274080574733405\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgvaBNNcRO7\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a>.
