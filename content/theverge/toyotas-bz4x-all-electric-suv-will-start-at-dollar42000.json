The memorably named vehicle is Toyota’s first full EV and will go on sale in “spring, 2022” — though the company’s site notes that availability will be “<em>extremely </em>limited” (emphasis Toyota’s) as Toyota <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Toyota-plans-10-production-cut-in-May-on-supply-chain-turmoil\">struggles to keep up production</a> amidst supply chain constraints.</p><p id=\"Jrx59z\">Toyota says the base model bZ4X has an estimated EPA range of 252 miles — around the same mileage as the $33,500 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22280449/chevy-bolt-ev-euv-super-cruise-range-price-specs\">Chevy Bolt EUV</a>, around 60 miles less than the $40,900 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22960060/kia-ev6-review-electric-specs-price\">Kia EV6</a>, and about 30 miles more than the $39,700 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22833165/hyundai-ioniq-5-pricing-ev\">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>. It is worth noting that these prices aren’t including destination charges, which could add a grand or two. In Toyota’s case, the bZ4X has a “Delivery, Processing and Handling fee of $1,215.” Some automakers will also let you upgrade to an extended battery for more range, which isn’t currently an option with the bZ4X.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IvOmRZdW22yvRrDQPggXa2A6ct8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966631/20211029_01_06.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Toyota</cite>      <figcaption><em>I wasn’t able to find this image on Toyota’s </em><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.toyota.com/bz4x/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>current bZ4X page</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"1JfM63\">Interestingly, the steering yoke Toyota showed off when it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752539/toyota-bz4x-electric-suv-steering-yoke-solar-roof\">announced the bZ4X in October</a> seems to be absent from Tuesday’s press release and the vehicle’s <a href=\"https://www.toyota.com/bz4x/features/mpg_other_price/2870/2880\">options</a> and <a href=\"https://www.toyota.com/bz4x/photo-gallery/\">image gallery</a> pages.

Given that Subaru’s version will have standard all-wheel-drive (an approximately $2,000 option on Toyota’s SUV), it may have to skimp on other features to get a starting price below $42,000. For comparison, Toyota’s 2022 GR86 <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a38070165/2022-toyota-gr86-price/\">is about $230 cheaper than its Subaru BRZ twin</a>, with no difference in the number of drive wheels.</p><p id=\"IKS8yG\">There is one more wrinkle to consider if you’re deciding between the two or pricing out a bZ4X against other EVs: the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/businesses/irc-30d-new-qualified-plug-in-electric-drive-motor-vehicle-credit\">$7,500 federal tax credit</a>. While a lower tax burden isn’t quite the same as a lower sticker price, it’s certainly an incentive — one that Toyota buyers may not be able to take advantage of for much longer. <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2022/04/11/federal-tax-credits-will-soon-be-phased-out-for-toyota-ev-customers-in-the-us/\">According to <em>Electrek</em></a>, the company sells enough hybrids that its executives estimate buyers won’t be able to get the full $7,500 by the end of 2022. For people buying Toyotas, the credit could end up being halved to $3,750 in October and then halved again in April 2023. Subaru customers, on the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.walser-subaru.com/2023-subaru-solterra-ev-reservations.htm\">may be eligible for the full tax credit</a>.</p><p id=\"g9Fmn6\"></p>",
