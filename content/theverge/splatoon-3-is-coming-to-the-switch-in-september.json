Nintendo has announced that <em>Splatoon 3</em> will hit the Nintendo Switch on September 9th. The colorful shooter was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288279/splatoon-3-nintendo-switch-2022\">previously pegged to launch sometime this summer</a>.</p><p id=\"dRiVhF\">Like past entries in the series, <em>Splatoon 3</em> is a four-on-four shooter that’s like a cross between paintball and <em>Call of Duty</em> where teams of humanoid creatures called Inklings and Octolings compete to paint a battlefield a particular color. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15986256/splatoon-2-nintendo-switch-review\">The lack of violence and vibrant tone have helped differentiate the series from the glut of other competitive shooters</a>. The new entry will introduce the typical new weapons and stages along with an improved co-op experience and what looks to be a much more in-depth single-player campaign.</p><p id=\"HRafFH\">With <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23001375/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-2-sequel-delay-release-date\">the recent delay of the sequel to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> to 2023</a>, <em>Splatoon 3</em> will likely be one of Nintendo’s biggest holiday releases. Nintendo also announced earlier this week that the sci-fi RPG <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>, which had previously been planned for a September release, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23031820/xenoblade-chronicles-3-nintendo-switch-release-date\">would now be coming on July 29th</a>.</p>",
