Now it has adjusted Live Redirects so that live streamers on the service <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/162234978\">can bounce their audience to another livestream when they go offline</a>. A premiere launch event for the film <a href=\"https://www.paramount.com/press/paramount-announces-exclusive-partnership-with-youtube-for-global-livestream-celebrating-paramount-pictures-top-gun-maverick?linkId=163315497\"><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em></a> on Wednesday will be one of the first big events to take advantage of the new addition.</p><p id=\"QDiWj5\">On Twitch, this behavior is called a raid. On one hand, it’s a good way to help grow audiences and find new content, but it has also been a conduit for harassment on the platform as “hate raids” would target marginalized streamers with abuse from hundreds of accounts at a time. </p><aside id=\"zwhdN2\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Raids are the best thing about live-streaming \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21234731/raids-twitch-mixer-live-streaming-community\"},{\"title\":\"How to stop a hate raid\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools\"},{\"title\":\"Twitch viewership noticeably dropped when streamers took a day off in protest \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654534/streamers-twitch-walkout-viewership-drop\"}]}'></div></aside>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"YouTube Live Redirect example flow\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RG8NNZAkJaVY_5V5SuOlkT3_cXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23436439/live_redirect_forum_example__1_.png\">      <cite>Image: YouTube Support</cite>      <figcaption><em>YouTube Live Redirect example flow</em></figcaption>  </figure><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"p0BRte\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Creators: Live Redirect is here!

From the start, however, YouTube Live Redirects can only point to channels that subscribe to the streamer or that have explicitly added that channel to an allowed list. In addition, only channels with more than 1,000 subscribers and no active community guideline strikes can send a Live Redirect. </p><p id=\"xAMBGM\">Now that the feature is live, we’ll be able to see how streamers use it, but building in default settings that give streamers one less thing to worry about should be a good start. YouTube previewed Live Redirects <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIBCfaI-LwQ&amp;t=90s\">in a March video</a> along with several <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/10/22925936/youtube-creators-feature-shopping-live-streaming-gifted-memberships\">other new features</a> that are coming as it tries to convince creators that this is the platform they should use instead of competitors like Twitch, Facebook, or TikTok.</p><div id=\"GYp3Uj\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aIBCfaI-LwQ?rel=0&amp;start=90\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"awHPiz\"></p>",
