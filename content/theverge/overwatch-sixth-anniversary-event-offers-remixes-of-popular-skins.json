In the <a href=\"https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/community-update-2022-in-game-events-retail/658530\"><em>Overwatch</em> Anniversary Remix: Volume 1</a>, <em>Overwatch</em> will open its vault, allowing players the chance to participate in the many special events of seasons past and earn “remixed” versions of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18715920/overwatch-legendary-skin-folklore-mythology-blizzard\">some of the game’s best skins</a>.</p><p id=\"6TxRCw\">The first week of the anniversary celebration starts on April 5th with the return of the Summer Games event and <em>Overwatch</em>’s <em>Rocket League-</em>like game mode Lucioball. If trying to score goals with an oversized soccer ball using nothing but a sound gun wielded by a frog DJ isn’t as appealing to you as it is to me, the next day’s event brings back Halloween Terror and, with it, <em>Overwatch</em>’s very own zombie horde mode. </p><aside id=\"IJtDyt\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Judge approves Activision Blizzard’s $18 million harassment settlement\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23001663/activision-blizzard-18-million-harassment-settlement-eeoc-dfeh\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"jqyJ9e\">In addition to replaying the seasonal game modes, the <em>Overwatch</em> Anniversary Remix event gives players the opportunity to earn all the season-specific and weekly challenge skins they may have missed out on. Players can also earn new “remixed” skins, which seem to be white-colored variants of old legendary cosmetics. </p><div id=\"qQp87l\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:11122828\"></div></div><p id=\"tpWhMO\">The <em>Overwatch</em> Anniversary Remix: Volume 1 is one of three anniversary events for this year and lasts until April 25th, just in time to kick off <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/18/22984763/overwatch-2-beta-release-date-faq-activision-blizzard\">the closed <em>Overwatch 2</em></a> beta starting April 26th.</p><p id=\"6gh5Zn\"></p><p id=\"AV4VIb\"></p>",
