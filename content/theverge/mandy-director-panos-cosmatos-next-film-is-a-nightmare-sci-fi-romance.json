The film, named <em>Nekrokosm</em>, has no premiere date but will be produced and released by A24 in partnership with XYZ Films. It’s billed as a “phantasmagorical fantasy nightmare” — in which “deep within a strange galaxy, two lovers are torn apart as they try to survive a malevolent invasion.”</p><p id=\"9rYUE7\">Houang has written for the excellent Starz sci-fi series <em>Counterpart</em> and the upcoming miniseries <em>Shōgun</em>, while Cosmatos<em> </em>is best known for the 2018 film <em>Mandy</em>, which pitted Nicolas Cage against a violent neo-hippie cult. (A highly memorable chainsaw duel — far from the strangest thing in the movie — was referenced briefly in the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22975245/unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-nicolas-cage-pedro-pascal-review-sxsw-2022\">new Cage meta-film</a> <em>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</em>.)</p><p id=\"xy0UHH\">There’s not a lot of detail yet about <em>Nekrokosm </em>beyond a press release first <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/mandy-panos-cosmatos-a24-xyz-films-sci-fi-fantasy-nekrokosm-1235117912/\">revealed by <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>. So it’s not clear whether it will follow <em>Mandy’s</em> path as a surreal but (relatively) conventionally paced action movie, or if we could see something more like the slow-burn trip of 2010’s <em>Beyond the Black Rainbow — </em>a film that didn’t reach the same broad audience but established the director’s distinctive retro-psychedelic style, as well as a penchant for exploring the dark side of countercultural idealism. But the press release refers to it as a “sci-fi epic”, which at least promises something appealingly ambitious for anyone who’s been waiting on a new Cosmatos project.</p>",
