The Communications Workers of America, which is working to organize the store, filed an unfair labor practice reporting the activity earlier today.</p><p id=\"RepKVc\">Workers at the Cumberland Mall Apple store filed for a union election in April. They say that while they love the company, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/29/23048296/apple-retail-store-union-atlanta-cumberland-mall-open-letter\">they want to have a bigger say in their compensation</a>, benefits, and store health protocols. </p><p id=\"2FRKGR\">The Cumberland store is one of three retail locations where workers have launched official union drives. Many more are in the process of organizing. </p><p id=\"YFXxt8\">Apple hasn’t said publicly whether or not it supports the union, but the company has distributed anti-union talking points to some store managers, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7v8qp/leaked-memo-reveals-apples-anti-union-talking-points-for-store-managers\">according to <em>Vice</em></a>. It has also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23041632/apple-hires-anti-union-lawyers-littler-mendelson-union-fight-cwa\">hired well-known anti-union lawyers from Littler Mendelson</a> to respond to the Atlanta union campaign.</p><p id=\"ihM9uc\">The company has started posting a two-page note in retail stores laying out Apple’s benefits and commitment to diversity and inclusion.</p><p id=\"EXmYH6\">Captive audience meetings are a controversial tactic in which workers are required by their bosses to attend meetings with anti-union messaging. Historically, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has allowed captive audience meetings up until the 24-hour period before an election. But an <a href=\"https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-general-counsel-jennifer-abruzzo-issues-memo-on-captive-audience-and\">April 7th memo from NLRB general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo</a> argued that such meetings violate the National Labor Relations Act, indicating that the board will take more aggressive action against the tactic going forward. </p><p id=\"hNCbIA\">“This license to coerce is an anomaly in labor law, inconsistent with the Act’s protection of employees’ free choice,” Abruzzo wrote. “It is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of employers’ speech rights.”</p><p id=\"pCMiVN\">The new policy is particularly relevant given Apple’s management practices for its retail employees. The company’s retail store shifts typically begin with a “daily download” meeting where leaders share news about the company. Since the union efforts have started to gain national attention, workers at brick and mortar locations across the country tell <em>The Verge </em>these meetings have started to incorporate themes like how to maintain a store’s culture and take advantage of existing benefits, as well as overt anti-union talking points.</p>",
