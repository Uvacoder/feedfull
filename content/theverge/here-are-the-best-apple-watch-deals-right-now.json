It might be tempting to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features\">order one of the Series 7 models</a>, but newer hardware always comes at a premium. And while Apple’s latest wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability, it is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. </p><p id=\"sxsAXI\">Thankfully, each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?</p><p id=\"FtR5HF\">There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021\">watchOS 8</a>. The highest-end is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. The last-gen model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399 as well, at least when it’s available. If either of those models seems too expensive, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.</p><p id=\"44jktU\">Finally, there’s the aging <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review\">Series 3</a>, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.</p><aside id=\"Yen8lP\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals\"},{\"title\":\"Here are the best iPad deals right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"hdRa4b\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10741666\"></div></div><h2 id=\"OlUIlK\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review\">Apple Watch Series 3</a> deals</h2><p id=\"c2iEiy\">The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a decent entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and solid build quality — especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range — but it’s also not one we would recommend picking up at this point. The design is aging, the processor is slower, and its paltry 8GB of internal storage hampers some of the more recent features introduced to the Apple Watch, like the ability to store music and podcasts for offline listening.</p><p id=\"DSKChG\">If you still want to go this route, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229763/9383?subId1=TheVergeAppleWatchDeals172022&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Gen-3-Series-3-38mm-Space-Gray-Aluminum-Black-Sport-Band-MTF02LL-A%2F706203065%3F&amp;veh=aff\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> is discounting the 38mm, GPS-enabled Series 3 by $30, bringing the price down to around $169, as is <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgPsLiPRehT\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>.
