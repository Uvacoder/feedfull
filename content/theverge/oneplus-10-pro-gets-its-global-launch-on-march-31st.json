The company has announced in a tweet that its latest flagship smartphone will launch globally on March 31st at 10am ET, a little over three months after it launched in China. There aren’t many new details to be revealed about the device itself, so the main news of the event will be the phones’ pricing and release date in markets like the US, Europe, and India.</p><p id=\"z8Ik1M\">OnePlus announced the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855743/oneplus-10-pro-android-specs\">10 Pro’s key specs</a> in January ahead of its launch in China, and since then reviewers have even imported the device to get an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IaYSxDp88s\">early look at what it offers</a> (raising some <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/21/22944852/oneplus-10-pro-snaps-in-half-durability-test-jerryrigeverything\">durability concerns</a> in the process). It’s powered by Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, has a 6.7-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED display, 5,000 mAh battery, 80W wired fast-charging, and 50W wireless charging.</p><div id=\"nIdc8k\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Get ready for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OnePlus10Pro?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#OnePlus10Pro</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0jmjb5GGAh\">pic.twitter.com/0jmjb5GGAh</a></p>— OnePlus (@oneplus) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oneplus/status/1506919144242892801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 24, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"4kyHiv\">Around back the phone has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22865569/oneplus-10-pro-camera-specs\">three cameras</a> consisting of a main 48-megapixel camera, 50-megapixel ultrawide, and 8-megapixel telephoto. A new RAW Plus mode will allow you to shoot RAW photos, while maintaining the benefits of computational photography. For selfies, there’s a 32-megapixel shooter up front. </p><p id=\"jx0czL\">If you’re expecting a OnePlus 10 to be announced alongside the OnePlus 10 Pro, then you might be disappointed. The company’s CEO Pete Lau recently suggested that it <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/oneplus-10\">won’t be announcing a cheaper non-Pro variant of its flagship device</a> as it did with the OnePlus 7, 8, and 9. </p>",
