In the past, the Pixel A-line opted for a cheaper, plastic build and slower processor to hit a lower price point. This time, the Pixel 6A uses the same Google Tensor processor that first debuted in the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review\">Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</a>, and yet it still undercuts its flagship brethren to sell at the same $449 price as the outgoing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs\">Pixel 5A</a> when preorders go up on July 21st and it hits stores on July 28th. </p><p id=\"c8LnVG\">So if you’re not giving up slower performance, what are you giving up? And why would anyone still spend more on a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro?</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mLAyMTGdfha0YwVm4UbZDArQSjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23449853/Pixel_6a_colors.jpeg\">      <cite>Image: Google</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Pixel 6A comes in three color options and is the first A-series Pixel to have a wraparound aluminum frame.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"BkzMYJ\">A blending of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 5A</h2><p id=\"W1xBMT\">Well, we’ve assembled all the key specs to see how the new Pixel 6A shapes up on paper when compared to the Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, and the Pixel 5A. You can see how the Pixel 6A has similarities with both the 5A and Pixel 6. The new 6A shares specs with the flagship Pixels, like the CPU and under-display fingerprint scanner, while maintaining some A-series sacrifices — like only having 128GB of storage, omitting wireless charging, a typical screen refresh rate of just 60Hz, and a lower weather resistance rating. While on the software side, all of these phones support Android 12 and will be updated to Android 13.</p><aside id=\"52DfXO\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Google I/O 2022: everything coming out of the online developers conference \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23065949/google-io-2022-android-pixel-watch-announcement-news\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"N8FtxZ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:11185848\"></div></div><p id=\"EKFtgp\">Perhaps the biggest deal-breakers for some Pixel A-series fans may be that the 6A doesn’t have a 3.5mm headphone jack, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644368/google-pixel-5a-headphone-jack-ad\">unlike the Pixel 5A</a>. It also no longer borrows the same rear cameras of its flagship counterparts, opting for a matched pair of 12-megapixel sensors for both the main and ultra-wide cameras — whereas the Pixel 6 has a 50-megapixel main sensor. But a welcome sight, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/10/22967827/apple-iphone-se-bigger-smartphone\">to some</a>, may be that the Pixel 6A is the smallest and lightest of this batch of Pixel phones. A 6.1-inch display isn’t exactly tiny, but it’s undeniably more wieldy than the massive 6.7-inch display on the Pixel 6 Pro. </p><p id=\"wV4xbr\">We’ll have to see how this all shakes out when we do our full review of the Pixel 6A and test how these specs translate to the real experience of using it. In the meantime, what do you think of how the Pixel 6A looks on paper compared to other Pixels?</p>",
