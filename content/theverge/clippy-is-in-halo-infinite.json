Interestingly, in most places the character shows up as “Clipster.” Clippy has also gone by Clippit, but “Clipster” isn’t a common nickname for them, as far as I’m aware. Maybe it’s just meant to signify that it’s <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-cooler-daniel\">a cooler version</a> of Clippy.</p><div id=\"gZIjxk\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\">  <a href=\"https://t.co/t8s4J0bu3L\">pic.twitter.com/t8s4J0bu3L</a></p>— James Shields (@shieldsjames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shieldsjames/status/1521589551260602368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 3, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"ZuGhbo\">The character isn’t new to <em>Halo</em>. Players reported that there was a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/3ru5xm/so_they_have_a_clippy_emblem/\">Clippy emblem in 2015’s <em>Halo 5</em></a>, and the idea of the character being available as an AI assistant <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/p8tocu/343i_lets_make_it_happen_for_us_y2k_spartans_via/\">got some attention on Reddit recently</a>, as <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/microsofts-neglected-baby-boy-clippy-is-in-halo-infinite/\"><em>PC Gamer</em> notes</a>. Someone on YouTube even made a video to show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKn_qIjYYlA\">what that would be like</a>, though I can’t say I’m 100 percent sure they really captured the essence of the Microsoft assistant. (But I’ll still admit to laughing at “Clipped! I’m sorry... clapped.”)</p><p id=\"eiLREa\">While I love to see small Clippy references, it does feel like the character should show up at some point in <em>Halo</em>’s story. I mean, think about it: Clippy is an assistant created by Microsoft. You know who else fits that description? Cortana. I’m begging the <em>Halo</em> devs to put a scene in the next game where you see the AI’s family tree and way off near the beginning are Clippy and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkU4WWEUj-Y\">Microsoft Bob’</a>s Rover. (Maybe that’d also be a chance to sneak in a reference to “Bingo,” the name that was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22846906/steve-ballmer-cortana-windows-phone-assistant-name-bingo-alyx-microsoft\">apparently almost given to the real-world Cortana</a>.)</p><aside id=\"NjEJcJ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Microsoft resurrects Clippy again after brutally killing him off in Microsoft Teams\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22756973/microsoft-clippy-microsoft-teams-stickers-return\"}]}'></div></aside>",
