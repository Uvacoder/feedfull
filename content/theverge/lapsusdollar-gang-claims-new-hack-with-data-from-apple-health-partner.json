In a post shared through the group’s Telegram channel on Wednesday, Lapsus$ claimed to have stolen 70GB of data from Globant — an international software development firm headquartered in Luxembourg, which boasts some of the world’s largest companies as clients.</p><p id=\"73aU2e\">Screenshots of the hacked data, originally posted by Lapsus$ and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlvieriD/status/1509001282031394816\">shared on Twitter</a> by security researcher Dominic Alvieri, appeared to show folders bearing the names of a range of global businesses: among them were delivery and logistics company DHL, US cable network C-Span, and French bank BNP Paribas.</p><p id=\"aQ2PCE\">Also in the list were tech giants Facebook and Apple, with the latter referred to in a folder titled “apple-health-app.” The data appears to be development material for Globant’s BeHealthy app, described in a prior <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/globant-launches-earn-your-apple-watch-program-301309647.html\">press release</a> as software developed in partnership with Apple to track employee health behaviors using features of the Apple Watch. Apple did not a request for comment at time of publication.</p><div id=\"qjprc5\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Facebook, DHL, BNPParibas, Abbott…<br><br>Lapsus$ making a statement post which needs to be verified.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/campuscodi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@campuscodi</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vxunderground?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@vxunderground</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cybersecurity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cybersecurity</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/infosec?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#infosec</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lapsus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Lapsus</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FNPzz10vTt\">https://t.co/FNPzz10vTt</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/lBQ1oN37hL\">pic.twitter.com/lBQ1oN37hL</a></p>— Dominic Alvieri (@AlvieriD) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlvieriD/status/1509001282031394816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"kCAqOY\">Globant acknowledged the hack <a href=\"https://www.globant.com/news/globant-official-update\">in a press release</a> later the same day. “According to our current analysis, the information that was accessed was limited to certain source code and project-related documentation for a very limited number of clients,” the company said. “To date, we have not found any evidence that other areas of our infrastructure systems or those of our clients were affected.”</p><p id=\"PvYjGi\">On Telegram, Lapsus$ shared a torrent link to the allegedly stolen data with a message announcing, “We are officially back from a vacation.”</p><p id=\"kFpVXj\">If confirmed, the leak would show a swift return to activity after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994563/lapsus-hacking-group-london-police-arrest-microsoft-nvidia\">seven suspected members of Lapsus$ were arrested</a> by British police less than a week ago.</p><p id=\"fJRnXZ\">The arrests, first reported on March 24th by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60864283\">BBC News</a>, were carried out by City of London Police after a yearlong investigation into the alleged ringleader of the gang, who is believed to be a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-23/teen-suspected-by-cyber-researchers-of-being-lapsus-mastermind?sref=ylv224K8\">teenager living with his parents in Oxford</a>. On the other side of the Atlantic, the FBI is also <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/lapsus\">seeking information on Lapsus$</a> related to the breach of US companies.</p><p id=\"8ayYtW\">The Lapsus$ gang has been remarkably prolific in the range and scale of companies it has breached, having previously extracted data from a number of well-known technology companies, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22957212/nvidia-confirms-hack-proprietary-information-lapsus\">Nvidia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/7/22965220/samsung-hack-lapsus-galaxy-source-code-confirmed-nvidia\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991409/lapsus-microsoft-security-windows-source-code\">Microsoft</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/10/vodafone-investigating-hackers-claims-threatening-to-leak-source-code.html\">Vodafone</a>.</p><p id=\"gmmGEf\">Most recently, Lapsus$ was in the spotlight for a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22990637/okta-breach-single-sign-on-lapsus-hacker-group\">hack affecting the authentication platform Okta</a>, which put thousands of businesses on high alert against subsequent breaches. The latter hack has been an embarrassment for a company that provides security services to other businesses and led to criticism of Okta for a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22992894/okta-hack-cso-security-protocol-sitel-lapsus\">slow disclosure</a>.</p><p id=\"q5zntM\"><em><strong>Correction, 1:38PM ET:</strong></em><em> A previous version of this post overstated the connection between the breached data and Apple. The data labelled as “apple-health” was not data from Apple itself, but from an app developed in partnership with Apple. The Verge regrets the error.</em></p><p id=\"y0caQU\"><em><strong>Update 5:25 PM ET: </strong></em><em>Added statement from Globant.</em></p>",
