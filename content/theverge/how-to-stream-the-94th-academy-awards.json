With vaccinations now widely available, theaters saw <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22843051/movie-theaters-spider-man-no-way-home-records-amc-regal-cinemark\">record-breaking ticket sales</a> as moviegoers seemed more willing to return to auditoriums to watch highly anticipated releases. But theaters haven’t completely edged out streamers — Netflix swept up a dozen nominations for its critically acclaimed drama <em>The Power of the Dog</em> and several more for its doomsday comedy <em>Don’t Look Up</em>.</p><p id=\"Zfucc9\">Folks with traditional cable bundles or an antenna are already teed up to watch the event live on ABC when it airs this evening. But if you’re short the hardware or a cable box, several services will carry the coverage as well.</p><h2 id=\"DRQuRk\">Who is hosting the Oscars?</h2><p id=\"8zy3EB\">Wanda Sykes, Regina Hall, and Amy Schumer are hosting the 94th Academy Awards, but expect plenty of other celebrity guest appearances during the event. Presenters include Josh Brolin, Jacob Elordi (aka <em>Euphoria</em>’s Nate Jacobs), Jake Gyllenhaal, Wesley Snipes, Uma Thurman, Zoë Kravitz, Sean “Diddy” Combs, Jason Momoa, Jill Scott, J.K. Simmons, Serena Williams, Venus Williams, and Tony Hawk, among others. </p><p id=\"xeVGHO\">In addition, Beyoncé, Billie Eilish and Finneas, Reba McEntire, and Sebastián Yatra are all expected to perform Oscar-nominated titles during the event.</p><div id=\"OX27Ra\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fx_6Fz8RN-c?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><h2 id=\"lHIKpw\">What time do the Oscars begin?</h2><p id=\"C9le6w\">The Oscars will begin at 8PM ET on ABC.</p><h2 id=\"n1hvK7\">Where can I watch the Oscars online?</h2><p id=\"4eTPLA\">Viewers can watch the event on abc.com or the ABC app by logging in through their provider.
