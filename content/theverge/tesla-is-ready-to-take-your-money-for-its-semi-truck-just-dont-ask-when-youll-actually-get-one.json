On the company’s <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/semi/reserve#payment\">website</a>, you can make a reservation by paying $5,000 upfront, then $15,000 within 10 days. (Spotted <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/586072/tesla-semi-order-books-open/\">via <em>InsideEVs</em></a>.) A word of warning, though: the $5k is refundable, but it seems the $20k ain’t. </p><p id=\"No7VzM\">Now, you’d be forgiven for having forgotten all about Tesla’s Semi, which was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16667366/tesla-semi-truck-announced-price-release-date-electric-self-driving\">announced in 2017</a> with futuristic concept art and envious specs. The company says the truck will be powered by four independent motors on the rear axles, go 0-60mph in 20 seconds, and have a battery range of either 300 or 500 miles. Prices start at $150,000, and there have been a number of orders from businesses like Walmart and FedEx in the low-dozens range. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"wr56pY\"><q>Prices for the 300 mile Semi currently start at $150,000</q></aside></div><p id=\"WKFm96\">But since that 2017 unveiling, Tesla has struggled with production for the Semi — which is understandable considering how quickly its managed to scale up manufacturing on its <em>other</em> EVs. Currently, the truck is scheduled to go into production next year, but we wouldn’t be too surprised if there are further delays (or even spec changes). </p><p id=\"cYoe0F\">What this news really demonstrates, though, is Tesla’s incredible ability to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-burns-cash/\">generate cash flow from customers</a> by encouraging them to put down deposits for products that don’t yet exist (a trend that has since been <a href=\"https://youtu.be/a6zvvlrd-jw\">copied by other EV manufacturers</a>). Essentially, paid reservations are a way for the company to take out interest-free loans from fans. So even if the Semi isn’t much closer to production, it’s certainly ready to generate deposits.</p>",
