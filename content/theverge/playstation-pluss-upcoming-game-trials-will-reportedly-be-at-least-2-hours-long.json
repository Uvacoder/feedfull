According to sources speaking to <a href=\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/timed-game-trials-are-now-a-requirement-for-some-playstation-developers\"><em>Game Developer</em></a> these free trials will be required for any game with a wholesale cost of $34 (€33) or above, and must be at least two hours long. They won’t be required for previously released games, or PlayStation VR titles. </p><p id=\"FEzYRw\"><em>Game Developer</em>’s initial report raised concerns that requiring developers to offer these time-limited trials could place a significant burden on smaller teams. However, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1519351210578530308\"><em>Kotaku’s </em>Ethan Gach</a> reports that the PlayStation Store team will create the trials, suggesting developers shouldn’t have to put any extra work in. </p><div id=\"DB8YX5\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Source tells me PlayStation Store team will create the 2 hour timed trials for developers, so it shouldn't be extra work, though I've heard concerns from others about Sony monetizing a perk and not sharing that revenue with studios <a href=\"https://t.co/0fYZZSVQxq\">https://t.co/0fYZZSVQxq</a></p>— AmericanTruckSongs8 (@ethangach) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1519351210578530308?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 27, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"xUpZfn\">Custom demos with original content could be allowed in some cases, rather than providing a time-limited slice of the original game according to <em>Game Developer</em>, but either way developers will have to make a trial available within three months of a title going on sale, and be available for at least a year. Developers will still be able to offer promotional material like free play weekends outside of the PlayStation Plus Premium tier.</p><p id=\"rhSnHQ\">It sounds like good news for anyone planning to sign up for Sony’s $18 a month PlayStation Plus Premium tier, which is currently penned for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/22/23037384/sony-playstation-plus-new-tiers-launch-date\">release in the US on June 13th</a>, and in Europe on June 22nd. If accurate, these reports suggest time-limited trials will be widely available for premium-priced titles, and two hours is a decent chunk of time to work out if a game is worth buying outright. </p><p id=\"YyrMvJ\">But <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-free-game-demo-sony-ps5-playstation-s-1848845074\"><em>Kotaku</em> has raised concerns</a> that offering time-limited trials could potentially impact sales, with people getting their fill of a game from a limited demo rather than making a purchase. On the other hand, a trial might encourage a purchase from someone that was previously on the fence. </p>",
