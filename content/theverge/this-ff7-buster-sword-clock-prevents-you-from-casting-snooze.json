The sound quality doesn’t seem great, but it might be worth dealing with so that Sephiroth’s theme song is the first thing you hear every morning.</p><div id=\"PKz4u3\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x4zGaAKBdnY?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"uEHP5L\">Before you get ready to drop some gil on the clock, there are a few not-so-good things I should mention. For one thing, the clock costs... $199.99. If you put money down now, you’re only preordering the clock ahead of an expected January 2023 release date. According to Square’s website, the clock only shows 24-hour time. And you better hope that the weak-sounding speakers can fully wake you up, because the clock is also missing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22800691/snooze-button-alarm-clock-sleep-gadget-worst-best\">a snooze button</a>.</p><p id=\"93GuW8\">But, if you’re willing to wait, <em>really</em> want to own a miniature replica of Cloud’s Buster Sword, and are okay living dangerously without a snooze button, you might want to put in <a href=\"https://store.na.square-enix-games.com/en_US/product/723020/final-fantasy-vii-remake-digital-clock-buster-sword?store_click=1&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=SEA%20-%20SQEX%20Store%20-%20Buster%20Sword%20Digital%20Clock\">your preorder now</a>. While you wait, perhaps your dreams will be filled with the classic songs of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> — soon enough, you’ll be able to hear them from the official clock, too.</p><aside id=\"4Rb2hg\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Final Fantasy VII Remake is a thrilling, thoughtful take on a classic\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4\"},{\"title\":\"Just how big is Final Fantasy VII’s materia anyway?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21203140/final-fantasy-vii-remake-materia-size-aerith-hair-director-hamaguchi\"},{\"title\":\"Cloud Strife’s muscle mass on PS5: a very important investigation\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/25/22302175/cloud-strife-arms-muscles-ps5-final-fantasy-vii-7-remake-intergrade\"}]}'></div></aside>",
