Starting in May, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152817/toyota-pony-ai-self-driving-car-investment-valuation-china-silicon-valley\">Toyota-backed</a> robotaxi service will operate 100 autonomous vehicles in the Nansha district of Guangzhou, and will later expand to serve other portions of the city.</p><p id=\"72MJq6\">Pony.ai says riders can hail and pay for rides from the company’s app between 8:30AM to 10:30PM, and that its fares will align with the “standard taxi pricing” in Guangzhou. The autonomous vehicles will also have a driver present in the car for safety purposes, but plans to remove them over a “short to intermediate time frame.”</p><p id=\"U5ugdH\">In November, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/baidu-ponyai-approved-robotaxi-services-beijing-2021-11-25/\">Chinese startup gained approval</a> — but not a license — to operate 67 vehicles in Beijing. It’s also been working to establish a presence in the US, a prospect set back after one of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834496/pony-ai-av-test-permit-suspend-california-dmv-crash\">its autonomous vehicles crashed in California</a>, resulting in its permit getting suspended. The company had been testing its vehicles in the state <a href=\"https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-authorizes-pony-ai-to-test-driverless-vehicles-in-fremont-milpitas-and-irvine/\">since 2017</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22449084/chinese-startup-pony-ai-autonomous-vehicles-california\">received a permit to operate its vehicles</a> without drivers last year. </p><p id=\"GFRFld\">Pony.ai says it has completed over 700,000 trips since April 2022, and almost 80 percent of riders are repeat customers.</p>",
