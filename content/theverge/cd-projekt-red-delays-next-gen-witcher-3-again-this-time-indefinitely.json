CDPR <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22649551/cyberpunk-2077-witcher-3-next-gen-ps5-xbox-series-upgrade-update-release-announcement\">originally targeted</a> a late-2021 release date for the free next-gen upgrade for the game, but the developer later <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736560/cd-projekt-red-delay-cyberpunk-2077-witcher-3-2022\">pushed that to Q2 2022</a>, and now, it’s unclear exactly when we might be able to play it.</p><p id=\"TKWl51\">“We have decided to have our in-house development team conduct the remaining work on the next-gen version of <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>,” CDPR said via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1514285274553008135\">the official <em>The Witcher</em> Twitter account</a>. “We are currently evaluating the scope of work to be done and thus have to postpone Q2 release until further notice.” The change was made “based on recommendations from persons in charge of development,” <a href=\"https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-10-2022/\">according to a note for investors</a>.</p><div id=\"5hHe9q\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We'll update you as soon as we can.

However, the next-gen upgrade for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/15/22933552/cyberpunk-2077-next-gen-update-patch-ps5-xbox-series-x\"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> hit in February</a>, adding some major improvements like ray tracing support, faster loading times, and, on the PS5, support for DualSense controller features like adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. That game seems to be much improved from its original launch, which had <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches\">scores of bugs</a> even after developers were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494499/cyberpunk-2077-development-crunch-time-cd-projekt-red\">reportedly forced to crunch</a> to get the game out the door to hit <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536662/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-delay-december\">its own delayed release date</a>.</p><p id=\"AkBXmJ\"></p>",
