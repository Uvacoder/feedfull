On Thursday, the Department of Treasury <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20220414\">updated sanctions</a> to include the wallet address that received the funds and attributed it to the Lazarus group. </p><p id=\"uM7RIu\">In <a href=\"https://roninblockchain.substack.com/p/community-alert-ronin-validators?s=w\">an updated post</a> about the incident, the Ronin network, which is owned by developer group Sky Mavis, explains the US Department of Treasury and FBI have pinned the attack on Lazarus. “We are still in the process of adding additional security measures before redeploying the Ronin Bridge to mitigate future risk,” the post reads. “We expect to deliver a full post mortem that will detail security measures put in place and next steps by the end of the month.” Ronin says it will bring its bridge back online “by the end of the month.” The bridge allows users to transfer funds between other blockchains and <em>Axie Infinit</em>y and has been blocked off since the attack.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"Yyi5do\"><q>The flagged wallet address currently contains over $445 million USD</q></aside></div><p id=\"CxKvX2\">As noted by <em>Vice</em>, the flagged wallet address currently contains over $445 million USD (148,000 Ethereum) and sent almost $10 million (3,302.6 ETH) to another address less than a day ago.
