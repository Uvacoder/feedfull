(Yes, I was using Apple’s own Clear Case with MagSafe, not some third-party knockoff.)</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGKgdGSoVtUCmkvmzsTidUJvvb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733367/DSC02789_dbohn_verge.jpg\">      <cite>Dieter Bohn / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The MagSafe Battery Pack on an iPhone 12 Pro Max.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"McMlsO\">And so you can understand why I’m having a hard time imagining that getting <em>better</em> now that the MagSafe Battery Pack puts out more juice. In <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini\">our review of the MagSafe Battery Pack</a>, Dieter pointed out that the 5W charging speed was meant to minimize heat and preserve the battery’s longevity. </p><p id=\"oeAkau\">Now, perhaps Apple has made other tweaks as well that will negate the heat issue — the company might have changed the frequency and duration of the charge. Perhaps if it charges at 7.5W for short periods, it’ll need to charge less often, and it might even be less annoying for those of us carrying it around all day. </p><p id=\"Fkz11H\">If so, I might actually buy one again. I’ve reached out to Apple, and I’ll let you know what the company says.</p><aside id=\"hXOUoH\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory\"},{\"title\":\"A year later, Apple’s MagSafe continues to underwhelm \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728967/apple-magsafe-duo-wallet-cases-charging\"},{\"title\":\"Please don’t kill the iPhone Mini\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22980216/apple-iphone-mini-hopefully-alive\"}]}'></div></aside>",
