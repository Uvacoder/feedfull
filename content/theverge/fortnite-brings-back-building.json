This morning, <em>Fortnite</em> has re-enabled queues for its signature building feature; it was temporarily removed as part of the game’s latest season, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/20/22987308/fortnite-chapter-3-season-2-battle-pass-doctor-strange\">which launched on March 20th</a>. </p><p id=\"2l5HCi\">However, while building is back, the combat-focused spirit lives on in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23001300/fortnite-zero-build-mode\">the previously-introduced Zero Build mode</a>. For now, the two versions of the game live side-by-side with queues for both regular and Zero Build available for Solo, Duos, Trios, or Squad battle royale combat.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Fortnite queue with options for regular or Zero Build\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/58qReNEV4Iqx2WGbbS3yAWq6QNk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23362359/fortnite_menu.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Epic Games</cite>  </figure><div id=\"zhg3Fb\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Building Is Back - Play Your Way!<br><br>Sprint, climb, and smash your way to a Victory Royale whether you choose to build up in Fortnite Battle Royale or go no-builds in the new Fortnite Zero Build. <a href=\"https://t.co/4qay0vm17x\">pic.twitter.com/4qay0vm17x</a></p>— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1510255732964290563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 2, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></div><p id=\"GB8kBX\">The ability to harvest materials and build defensive structures has long been a defining trait of <em>Fortnite</em> — and part of what helped differentiate it from other battle royale games like <em>PUBG</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em> — which made its temporary removal all the more surprising. </p><p id=\"skGi97\">The absence of building was balanced out somewhat by the addition of mechanics designed to make the game more mobile, including climbing and a faster sprint.
