The Switch version runs “natively on the hardware,” according to a press email sent to <em>The Verge, </em>unlike Remedy’s cloud-streamed <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538173/control-cloud-version-nintendo-switch-release-remedy-entertainment\">Switch port of <em>Control</em></a>.</p><p id=\"z5v24M\">Remedy shared a few other <em>Alan Wake</em> series updates as well. When the studio announced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827225/alan-wake-2-confirmed-trailer-release-date\"><em>Alan Wake 2</em> in December</a>, Remedy creative director Sam Lake <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KRFsTbthfw&amp;t=148s\">indicated</a> we might hear more about the game this summer. But in a video published Thursday, he said we’re going to have to wait longer to see more of the game.</p><p id=\"lDLNcw\">“Everything [with <em>Alan Wake 2’s development</em>] is going really well,” <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6zoI3Egf-IQ?t=692\">Lake said</a>. “A great deal of the game is playable, [and] we are iterating it. But we’ve been talking for the past couple of months and we’ve come to a decision that we will not be showing anything big this summer.” <em>Alan Wake 2</em> is set to release in 2023.</p><div id=\"5Omuhr\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6zoI3Egf-IQ?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"1W7IJ8\">Remedy also shared that AMC Networks has bought the rights to the <a href=\"https://www.remedygames.com/alan-wake-tv/\">previously announced <em>Alan Wake</em> TV show</a>. “There’s still a long way to go for the series to become a reality, but we are excited, to say the least, about this latest development,” Remedy said in the press email.</p><p id=\"UfDs13\"></p><p id=\"EmERsM\"></p>",
