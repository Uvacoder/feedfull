Other retailers, like Amazon and Walmart, are honoring the price cuts, too. Better yet, there’s a range of games included in this sale, suiting people who want a shooter, a turn-based strategy game, or a good ol’ 3D Mario platformer.</p><p id=\"xy1plZ\"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> is an inviting and delightful take on the traditional 3D Mario game, giving Mario a throwable cap to vastly extend his move set and to possess objects to get around levels. If you’re fatigued by open-world games that have lots of objectives, it may be refreshing to play this, where your only goal is to jump, climb, and collect shiny things.</p><div id=\"IvBkG7\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9514828\"></div></div><p id=\"SMxL2V\"><em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em> is the turn-based tactical title that I mentioned earlier. The game essentially has two parts: one that feels like a spin on a <em>Persona </em>game, where you’re building relationships with your students-turned-warriors, and the other part that sees you taking on foes in interesting battles that never overstay their welcome.</p><div id=\"eHWqPG\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9575178\"></div></div><p id=\"E9epun\"><em>Splatoon 2</em> is an off-beat, unique third-person shooter where you play as squid-like humanoids who shoot paint at each other. This game has clever weaponry (sort of akin to <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>), and similar to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, its story mode offers a simple structure, letting you zone out on your way to the goal (which in this game’s case is sniping a lot of enemies).</p><div id=\"FQUGeg\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10999830\"></div></div><p id=\"5Byfg2\">And, of course, you should buy <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. It was released alongside the Switch, but as my colleague Sam Byford wrote on the game’s five-year anniversary, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22959702/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-open-world-five-year-anniversary\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">it set an extremely high bar</a> as an immersive, open-world action game that competing titles have struggled to meet. If you’re a Zelda fan, you’ll probably gobble this up, but new players should have a great time, too.</p><div id=\"GTuKWr\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10516697\"></div></div><p id=\"fvlDy3\">Amazon is, once again, selling its third-generation Echo Dot smart speaker for next to nothing, with a couple of strings attached. You can get the charcoal-colored speaker for $1 so long as you’ve never owned an Echo device on your Amazon account and so long as you sign up for one month of its Amazon Music Unlimited service, which costs $7.99 monthly for Prime members and $9.99 each month for non-members.</p><p id=\"cmBygT\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0873C4C67/ref=s9_acss_bw_cg_AMUVBNPA_md1_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&amp;pf_rd_r=7DS45SKAQNV3GZXEWQKH&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=977b4b08-d617-4a1e-9c1b-2d0bf8e21acd&amp;pf_rd_i=21390537011&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Your total will come out to $8.98 at checkout</a> if you’re on Prime or $10.98 for non-Prime members. And, just so you know, the streaming service subscription will be set to auto-renew each month, so keep that in mind.</p><div id=\"TdpAlI\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10880531\"></div></div><p id=\"wFfSJc\">A three-pack of Blink’s wireless Outdoor cameras costs $159.99 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-Wireless-Security-Camera-3cam/dp/B086DKSHQ4?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg2bOOOjXJu\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, down from the usual $249.99 cost for the bundle. This price drop matches the big discount that occurred in mid-February. These cameras run on AA batteries, and the company claims that you’ll get two years of use before needing to replace them. </p><p id=\"YgltD4\">The camera system includes a complimentary 30-day trial to Blink’s subscription that lets you record, view, and save clips. It costs $3 per month per camera after that or $10 per month for unlimited cameras. Alternatively, if you’d prefer a local storage solution, you can pick up the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084RQ6MHJ?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blink Sync Module 2 for $34.99</a>, which can save clips and photos from up to 10 Blink cameras.</p><div id=\"8hDyJJ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10881526\"></div></div><h2 id=\"vVQe0L\">A few other deals you might dig</h2><ul><li id=\"SD9a0f\">JBL’s Flip 5 Bluetooth speaker in red is just <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsRoundup041422/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/jbl-flip-5-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker-23\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$94.99 at Woot</a>, a $35 discount off its usual price.
