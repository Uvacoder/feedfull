But you shouldn’t expect to see it in this year’s iPhone lineup, as the changeover wouldn’t happen until 2023 “at the earliest,” Gurman says. The report follows reliable Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23066661/apple-iphone-15-drop-lightning-port-usb-c-2023-prediction-rumor\">Ming-Chi Kuo’s tweets this week</a> indicating Apple would swap to USB-C in the second half of 2023, which is presumably when that year’s iPhone lineup will be released.</p><p id=\"kvj3JR\">The switch would be a big one, though it’s not a complete surprise. Apple has already moved the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini to USB-C. And the EU revealed a proposal <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones\">in September</a> that would require many devices, including smartphones, to include USB-C ports — Gurman says that this legislation was “a key reason” for Apple’s move to consider the change. There are also technical benefits to moving to USB-C, which is capable of faster transfer speeds than Lightning.</p><p id=\"nsDkVR\">Rumors have also swirled about Apple developing a portless iPhone, and Gurman says that Apple has “worked on iPhones without any charging port” in “recent years.” But his report Friday doesn’t suggest a portless iPhone will be available anytime soon.</p><p id=\"WgkVGE\">Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. The company first introduced the Lightning port <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/12/3319764/iphone-5-lightning-dock-connector-design\">with the iPhone 5 in 2012</a>.</p>",
