A new <em>Minecraft</em> Preview build is available to Xbox Insiders, and it includes limited ray tracing support. The latest test build is also marked as optimized for Xbox Series X / S, suggesting that a next-gen patch is coming soon.</p><p id=\"nfgjD3\">I’ve been testing out the latest <em>Minecraft</em> Preview, and have been able to successfully enable some ray tracing support. It’s not a simple switch, though. <em>Minecraft</em>’s ray tracing is enabled through additional resource packs, and there’s no easy way of downloading and installing these in the Xbox version of the game right now. There’s a workaround, though. You can host a <em>Minecraft </em>session on a Windows PC with the packs enabled, and an Xbox player can join that session and ray tracing will be enabled.</p><div id=\"hEOxEt\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Minecraft with raytracing on Xbox? The latest Minecraft Preview is optimized for Xbox Series S / X and has early raytracing support   <a href=\"https://t.co/cqH0cuGbtS\">pic.twitter.com/cqH0cuGbtS</a></p>— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1508574713110568962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 28, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"CJRqmF\">You’re then able to toggle ray tracing support on or off from the settings menu. While there is also a setting for upscaling support, this appears to be limited to Nvidia’s DLSS on the PC side right now. Hopefully that will eventually extend to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22993152/amd-fsr-2-0-xbox-nvidia-gpus\">AMD’s FSR 2.0 support on Xbox</a>, or other upscaling techniques.</p><p id=\"ZfyqqP\"><em>Minecraft </em>players on Xbox have been waiting a long time to hear about ray tracing on Xbox Series X / S. Microsoft <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/03/16/xbox-series-x-tech/\">originally teased</a> <em>Minecraft</em> ray tracing on Xbox Series X two years ago, and the addition of the support in the latest preview build suggests it could be on its way soon.</p><p id=\"0QpyX3\"><em>Minecraft</em>’s blocky aesthetic was originally upgraded as part of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163539/minecraft-rtx-ray-tracing-windows-released\">ray tracing launch</a> for the Windows 10 version of the game in December 2020. The ray tracing is most noticeable in water reflections or shadows within <em>Minecraft</em>, or through the additional detail in texture packs.</p>",
