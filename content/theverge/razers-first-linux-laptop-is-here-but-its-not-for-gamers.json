That isn’t<em> quite </em>changing today — but a company called Lambda is now putting Ubuntu on a souped-up version of last year’s Razer Blade 15 Advanced with Razer’s full blessing, with the aim of selling it to machine learning and artificial intelligence researchers.</p><p id=\"QyFmAa\">It’s called the <a href=\"https://lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/laptops/tensorbook\">Razer x Lambda Tensorbook</a>, and the $3,500 machine is absolutely identical to a high-end version of last year’s laptop in most ways. It’s got an 11th-gen Intel Core i7 CPU, Nvidia RTX 3080 Max-Q graphics and 64GB of RAM underneath a 15.6-inch 165Hz 1440p display, all powered by a 80Wh battery inside an identically sized and shaped 4.45-pound chassis. It’s also got the same speedy I/O, including two Thunderbolt 4 ports, three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, a UHS-III SD card reader and both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. </p><div id=\"7oUuSb\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FmtB5-ZMRH0?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"3W9oT3\">But the Tensorbook is silver instead of black, and comes preinstalled with “the latest drivers and machine learning tools including PyTorch, Tensorflow, CUDA, and cuDNN,” its own warranty and — if you pay $4,099 and up — its own premium support team. Lambda says it provides hardware to thousands of research groups already, selling access to cloud GPUs, servers, and desktop workstations.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"You can make out the keys and speaker grille, as well as the webcam\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sQ5UJIvyTNIvIL7yvd68r4Po7eg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23390952/stack1.png\">      <cite>Image: Razer x Lambda</cite>      <figcaption><em>A closer look at the Lambda Tensorbook.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"q8jxrC\">While Razer currently offers faster CPU, GPU and screens in today’s Blade lineup, it’s not necessarily a bad deal if you love the design, considering how pricey Razer’s laptops can be. But we’ve generally found that Razer’s thin machines run <em>quite hot </em>in our reviews, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22723299/razer-blade-15-advanced-late-2021-review-specs-features-design\">the Blade in question was no exception</a> even with a quarter of the memory and a less powerful RTX 3060 GPU. <a href=\"https://lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/laptops/tensorbook/faqs\">Lambda’s FAQ page</a> does not address heat as of today.</p><p id=\"E65hwj\">Lambda is clearly aiming this one at prospective MacBook Pro buyers, and I don’t just say that because of the silver tones. The primary hardware comparison the company touts is a 4x speedup over <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review\">Apple’s M1 Max in a 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> when running TensorFlow.</p><p id=\"W6Am73\">Razer has teased better Linux support over the years, but popular Linux computing news site <em>Phoronix</em> wrote in 2019 <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Razer-Linux-Laptop-2019-Stalled\">that those plans had seemingly been mothballed</a>. Perhaps the recently renewed interest in Linux gaming, driven by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review\">the Steam Deck,</a> will push Razer to consider Linux for its own core products as well.</p>",
