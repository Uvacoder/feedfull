More accurately, you can’t stop it being opportunistically mined by business types for lingering name-recognition and nostalgia. </p><p id=\"T8iMQQ\">Case in point: the pioneering peer-to-peer music-sharing-and-piracy service Napster has been bought by a consortium of companies who plan to “bring the iconic music brand to web3.” What exactly that means isn’t clear, mostly because web3 itself is such a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23020727/decoder-chris-dixon-web3-crypto-a16z-vc-silicon-valley-investing-podcast-interview\">nebulous concept</a>. However, other web3-focused music startups have let musicians release albums and singles as NFTs, so perhaps expect something similar in Napster’s reimagined future? </p><p id=\"WpHwIV\">To dive down into the murky waters here, the lead players buying Napster are <a href=\"https://hivemindcapital.co/\">Hivemind</a>, a “a crypto-focused investment firm dedicated to blockchain technologies, crypto companies and the digital assets ecosystem,” and <a href=\"https://www.algorand.com/\">Algorand</a>, operators of what is claimed to be “the world’s most decentralized, scalable, and secure blockchain infrastructure.” </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"LKGpuX\"><q>News of the acquisition was heavy on the buzzwords, light on the business plan</q></aside></div><p id=\"7U9Ik8\">Matt Zhang, a managing partner at Hivemind, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6929802236944420864/\">announced the acquisition on LinkedIn</a> (which we spotted <a href=\"https://musically.com/2022/05/11/napster-gets-bought-again-this-time-with-a-web3-pivot-in-the-works/\">via <em>MusicAlly</em></a>), noting that “volatile market and uncertain times often bring exciting opportunities,” and that “Music x Web3 is one of the most exciting spaces we’ve come across.” </p><p id=\"7gh22D\">Again: we’re doing great guns here when it comes to buzzword bingo, but explanations of what Napster’s future business model might actually be are thin on the ground. </p><p id=\"MIeNVz\">Never mind. It’s perhaps enough to know that Napster is in good (or at least familiar) company. Earlier this year, it was announced that fellow star of the early-2000s piracy firmament Limewire was being <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3n85w/piracy-icon-limewire-is-coming-back-but-as-an-nft-marketplace\">revived as a platform for NFTs</a>, while owners of the once-great (and aesthetically enduring) music player Winamp announced they’d be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981109/winamp-music-player-original-skin-sale-nft-crypto-opensea-auction\">selling the software’s original skin as an NFT</a> and creating the Winamp Foundation “to help musicians across the world to make the music they love.” (Is the blockchain involved? It’s not clear.)</p><p id=\"ZgslT0\">Although web3 advocates claim that tools like the blockchain and NFTs are a way to deliver more value to smaller players, these technologies have really come into their own as financial instrument for leveraging nostalgia. The list of mostly-defunct naughties brands that have been revived in this way is ever-expanding, from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22703881/neopets-nfts-crytpo-trend-raydium-solana\">Neopets</a> and <a href=\"https://hotwheelsnftg.io/\">HotWheels</a> to <a href=\"https://www.stereogum.com/2170755/crazy-frog-nfts-death-threats/news/\">Crazy Frog</a> and <a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/radioshack-defi-nft-collection/\">RadioShack</a>, but the overwhelming evidence is that these are corporate zombies — nominally alive but dead behind the eyes. Welcome to the team, Napster. </p>",
