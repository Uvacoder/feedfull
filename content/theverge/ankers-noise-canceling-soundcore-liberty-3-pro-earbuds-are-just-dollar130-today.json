One of the best things about this $30 discount is that it extends to all four colors: black, purple, gray, and white. The earbuds provide a lot of value, some quality sound, and even support nice extras like support for multipoint connections and Sony’s higher quality codec, LDAC. The active noise cancellation may not be the best around, but at $129.99, they’re closer in price to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">base-model AirPods</a> than pricier earbuds, offer a more unique look, and a come with a case that supports wireless charging. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22941399/anker-soundcore-liberty-3-pro-earbuds-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"vIuhTy\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11008759\"></div></div><p id=\"0ArEni\">If you’re looking for an exceptional value today on a robot vacuum, the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F6ICNE1ZOV7QF&amp;subid1=vergedailydeals050922\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ecovacs Deebot N8 Plus is currently on clearance at Walmart, where it’s available for $362 off</a>. The N8 line was the Ecovacs’ flagship before the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23037426/ecovacs-deebot-x1-omni-review-vacuum-mop-robot-voice-control\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new X1 series</a> came around, and today’s discount knocks the N8 Plus down to just $287.99. <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/chcMbENAASK\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy also has it for $399.99 on its deal of the day</a>, but the Walmart price is the lowest if you can get it before it’s gone.</p><p id=\"wJJqXG\">The N8 Plus is a midrange vacuum and mop hybrid, and it comes with a self-emptying station and lidar-powered mapping. It avoids obstacles as well, though it’s not the more advanced AI-powered smarts that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22880352/irobot-roomba-j7-plus-samsung-jet-bot-ai-plus-robot-vacuum-review-comparison-test\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">newer vacuums use to avoid pet accidents on the floor</a>. The N8 Plus’ mop doesn’t oscillate — it just drags it around to wipe the floor — though you’re getting quite the value for about $288, especially since most robovacs with self-emptying stations cost a fair amount more. </p><div id=\"AAHJWT\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11183119\"></div></div><p id=\"1g7PNn\">There are a few great deals on Pokémon games available today, including remasters and sequels to some ’90s and 2000s-era classics. First, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Brilliant-Diamond-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B08Y6HCHP8?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pokemon-Shining-Pearl-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B08Y74H4PB?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pokémon Shining Pearl</em></a><em> </em>are each $39.99 ($20 off) when you add them to your cart at Amazon and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/chcNZsKM3sD\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>. These are the latest Pokémon titles to get the remaster treatment, having launched last year on the Nintendo Switch with an all-new 3D style that has an especially cutesy charm. </p><p id=\"7spdHY\">Another notable sale going on is on <em>New Pokémon Snap</em>, the Switch sequel to the Nintendo 64 classic that has you photographing pokémon instead of catching or battling them. <em>New Pokémon Snap</em> is also on sale for $39.99 at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/chcMnEgQN82\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CWL8X61/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, a discount of $20 that applies when you add the game to your cart at either retailer. It’s still an on-rails experience just like the original, but there are many more pocket monsters and areas to check out. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22405886/new-pokemon-snap-review-nintendo-switch\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><p id=\"pRSwle\">If those titles feel a little too dated or nostalgia-reliant for your liking, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/chcPfhvjE4c\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pokémon Sword</em></a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/chcPgR2eB7w\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pokémon Shield</em> are also marked down to $39.99</a> at Best Buy. These are the latest releases in the mainline Pokémon franchise, exploring the new Galar region until the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/27/22953414/pokemon-scarlet-violet-nintendo-switch-2022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pokémon Violet</em> and <em>Scarlet</em> launch later this year</a>. </p><div id=\"HQ0HGk\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11183276\"></div></div><div id=\"miAVgx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10283625\"></div></div><div id=\"p6xVz6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9536540\"></div></div><p id=\"C7vCvM\">Most MSI laptops are not going to win beauty contests, with the focus usually being on specs and performance more than design. However, I’ll acknowledge that the MSI Sword 15 is a bit more of a looker, with a silver-and-black build that keeps things tidy and some nice midrange specs. Best of all, you can get this 15-inch laptop with an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU, GeForce RTX 3050 Ti GPU, 512GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/chcMsMy0r70\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">for $799.99 as part of today’s deal of the day at Best Buy</a>. </p><p id=\"X5TD9C\">While we haven’t reviewed this model from MSI, its lower asking price makes it fairly appealing if you’re on a tight budget and in the market for a 15-inch gaming laptop. Its screen has a resolution of just 1920 x 1080, which is nothing amazing given the size of the panel, but the 144Hz refresh should help keep most games looking smooth on modest graphics settings.</p><div id=\"BoSUmL\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10665627\"></div></div><p id=\"YBvdOi\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Backbone One</a> is a great choice for a mobile gaming controller for your smartphone, but it’s still currently only available for iPhones. When it comes to Android users, one of the best options around for attaching a proper game controller to your phone is the Razer Kishi. Thankfully, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086X8DHN2/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Razer Kishi is on sale at Amazon for $44.99</a>, one of its best prices to date. The half-off discount comes at a great time since <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/5/23058642/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-free-streaming-epic-games-microsoft\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">now you can play <em>Fortnite</em> for free with Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>. The Kishi definitely gives you an edge over anyone using touchscreen controls, as it’s a proper controller with full-size buttons and triggers. It can also fit most Android phones and features a portable, fold-up design, which collapses to become smaller. It even offers passthrough USB-C charging for your phone. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"cuem0f\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10882522\"></div></div><h2 id=\"ZKBeDU\">More deals for your Monday</h2><ul><li id=\"jBr6lz\">The Panasonic S5 full-frame mirrorless camera (body only) is $1,497.99 ($500 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Mirrorless-Recording-L-Mount-DC-S5BODY/dp/B08FF55MV4?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1581612-REG%2Fpanasonic_lumix_dc_s5_mirrorless_digital.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F5%2F9%2F23063343%2Fanker-liberty-soundcore-3-pro-pokemon-nintendo-switch-msi-sword-ecovacs-deebot-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>.
