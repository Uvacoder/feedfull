If you preorder Samsung’s 32-inch M8 4K smart monitor, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgU3aEIHeVp\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">starting at $699.99</a>, before April 17th, you’ll get a $100 Samsung credit to use on future purchases. Just a heads-up, though, that the white-colored model that costs $699.99 is currently set to deliver in early May. Other colors, like green and pink (which cost $30 more) will ship by April 18th. There’s a blue option, but it’s not available for preorder yet.</p><p id=\"dAIbqu\">The M8 monitor has some features that many others don’t. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/28/22999709/samsung-m8-4k-32-inch-smart-monitor-features-price-airplay-tv-apple-studio-display-comparison\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I wrote about them all here</a>, but if you want the skinny, here goes: it can run smart TV apps, like Apple TV Plus, Netflix, and more, even if you don’t have a computer or streaming device to connect to it. If you connect a mouse and keyboard to it, you can access Microsoft Office apps, too. What’s more, it includes a webcam that snaps onto the top, with which you can do video chats via Google Duo.</p><p id=\"OqeAHb\">Samsung says that the credit will expire on 12/31/2022, so keep that mind if that’s part of the reason why you’re buying this.</p><div id=\"CtXaq8\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11124921\"></div></div><p id=\"bt6okG\">Microsoft’s small, but capable <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2FN82E16868105274\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Series S console is $30 off its usual price at Newegg</a>. When you enter the code <strong>APRBRA338 </strong>at checkout, the price falls from $299.99 to $269.99 before tax. We’ve seen slightly better deals before, but regardless, if you’re a current or prospective Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, it’s like getting two months for free.</p><p id=\"JxiLMJ\">Just in case you weren’t aware, the Series S is little sibling to the Series X, and its features and power are, predictably, lesser. Notably, it lacks a disc drive, and it targets high frame rates at less than 4K resolution. So, it’s not the right console for a more discerning gamer who needs best-in-class performance. But it could be the perfect device for someone who needs a streaming device-meets-console. </p><div id=\"2fYVK3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9444105\"></div></div><p id=\"Cwa6p2\">If you’re a Costco member, you can snag <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/homepod-mini.product.100696292.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s HomePod Mini in white, blue, yellow, or space grey for $79.99</a>, which is $20 off the retail cost. This is in the same ballpark as the lowest price we’ve seen yet, though it’s not such a great deal for non-members. You can check out without a Costco membership, but it’ll add $4.75 (five percent of the cost) to your total.</p><p id=\"rTZLMW\">While the HomePod Mini has smaller sound than the larger (now discontinued) HomePod, it has nearly all of the same features. You can make commands at Siri with your voice, and it can control your HomeKit smart devices.</p><div id=\"1jiyB3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10883175\"></div></div><p id=\"iXTan9\">Roborock’s E4 robot vacuum is on a deep discount at Amazon, selling for $199.99 after you clip the on-page coupon. This model was recently nominated as the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“best robot vacuum on a budget” by <em>The Verge</em>’s smart home expert Jennifer Pattison Tuohy</a>. In her testing, the E4 had an impressive run time of about 200 minutes, and it has four levels of cleaning, ranging from powerful to a light mode that isn’t too loud. It doesn’t have the self-emptying bin of pricier models, but the bin it has is generously sized.</p><p id=\"Pf7StS\">Gee, robot vacuums are becoming affordable, yeah?</p><div id=\"u868zC\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11115332\"></div></div><h2 id=\"nAOGdC\">Some other deals you may want to check out</h2><ul><li id=\"AliyHn\">1Password is offering a great deal on its service for <em>Verge </em>readers who don’t yet have an account with the company.
