The tweet was posted in response to a user asking about a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22640827/youtube-picture-in-picture-mode-how-to-enable-premium-ios-iphone\">previous test of the feature</a>, which was available to YouTube Premium subscribers. The account did not specify whether availability will continue to be limited to YouTube Premium subscribers.</p><p id=\"IRVVl2\">YouTube’s PiP test with Premium users came to an end last week and disappeared from YouTube’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/new\">list of available experimental features</a>, where it was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220406002629/https://www.youtube.com/new\">previously listed</a> with an April 8th expiry date. Despite some users being shown a “The feature you’re trying has been turned off” banner after the end of the picture-in-picture test, others are reporting that they’re still able to access the feature. <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/04/09/youtube-pip-iphone-test/\">Both <em>9to5Google</em></a> <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/youtube-ends-picture-picture-experiment-iphone-without-launch\">and iMore</a> are reporting that the feature is still working on their YouTube Premium accounts that previously signed up to the test.</p><div id=\"nYPg1m\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Are you using an iOS smartphone? If so, the Picture-in-Picture feature is still rolling out &amp; will be available in a matter of days across all iOS 15+ devices.

First announced in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540482/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone-ipad-ios-app-free-premium\">June last year</a>, the beta period was originally set to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22640827/youtube-picture-in-picture-mode-how-to-enable-premium-ios-iphone\">end on October 31st</a>, before being extended. But although the test was only for Premium users, last month <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/30/23003709/youtube-tv-picture-in-picture-iphone-ipad\">YouTube reiterated</a> it hopes to roll out the feature for all iOS users in the US, including non-Premium users, “in the coming months.”</p><p id=\"RNIjxd\">Just last month, the search giant brought picture-in-picture support to its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/30/23003709/youtube-tv-picture-in-picture-iphone-ipad\">YouTube TV service on iOS</a>. Now, it seems ready to add the feature to its regular YouTube service. </p><p id=\"EpxpwG\"><em><strong>Update April 11th, 8:12AM ET:</strong></em><em> Updated with YouTube’s confirmation that picture-in-picture is launching “in a matter of days.” Also updated headline.</em></p>",
