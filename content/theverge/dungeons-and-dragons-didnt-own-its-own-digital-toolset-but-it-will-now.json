The popular tabletop role-playing game has licensed D&amp;D Beyond as its official subscription-based digital toolset <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15988688/dungeons-and-dragons-beyond-wizards-of-the-coast-digital-toolset-roleplaying-games\">since 2017</a>.  </p><p id=\"E4ALXr\">D&amp;D Beyond is the digital toolset for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, where users can create characters and run campaigns with fellow players. It’s also where players can buy digital versions of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> books, in addition to the subscription fees. <a href=\"https://dnd.wizards.com/news/announcement_04132022\">Wizards of the Coast is promising</a> that all purchases made, characters created, and campaigns run are not going anywhere. The all-cash acquisition is, however, still subject to regulatory approvals.</p><p id=\"yAX6s9\">You may have assumed that D&amp;D Beyond was produced and owned by the Dungeons &amp; Dragons owners all along, but it was operated by Fandom, the hosting service for nerdy wikis like <a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page\">Wookieepedia</a> and <a href=\"https://eldenring.fandom.com/wiki/Elden_Ring_Wiki\">this one</a> for <em>Elden Ring</em>. This deal shifts D&amp;D Beyond from a royalty-based revenue source for Wizards of the Coast to in-house development, and with that, it brings along its nearly 10 million registered users — who range from a <a href=\"https://support.dndbeyond.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010588728-Compare-Subscription-Plans\">free tier to a $5.99-per-month subscription</a> — as well as their precious data.</p><p id=\"SayK3D\">While you can already buy official D&amp;D digital content and source books through services like Roll20 and <em>Fantasy Grounds</em>, Hasbro is positioning itself to control more of the digital revenue stream instead of just relying on licensing and royalties — especially now, as it reports 80 percent of D&amp;D players have played the game digitally in 2021.</p><p id=\"HUdbeQ\"></p>",
