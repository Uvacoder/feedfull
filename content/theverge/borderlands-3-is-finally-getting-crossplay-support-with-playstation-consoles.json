That will change soon, as the company announced at PAX East that full crossplay support — including with PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 — will be arriving sometime in the spring, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-3-adding-full-cross-play-soon-following-playstation-holdout/1100-6502715/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f\"><em>GameSpot</em> reports</a>. When the feature is available, PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Stadia players will all be able to play the game with each other. </p><p id=\"ppHnao\">Sony has been resistant to enabling crossplay on some games in the past, originally blocking support for it in titles like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Rocket League </em>before eventually <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17905146/sony-fortnite-ps4-cross-play-support\">coming</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18182389/rocket-league-cross-play-enabled-ps4-switch-xbox-pc\">around</a>. However, <em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</em>, a <em>Borderlands</em> spinoff, launched in March with support for crossplay on all platforms, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/14/22977436/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-crossplay-playstation-xbox-pc\">including PlayStation</a>. At the time of that announcement, Gearbox Entertainment president Randy Pitchford hinted that PlayStation crossplay support for <em>Borderlands 3</em> might be near, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1503143404162666498\">tweeting that</a> the feature was “what I would consider to be inevitable.”</p><p id=\"hRlsbf\">We’ve asked Gearbox if it can provide a more specific timeline for when <em>Borderlands 3’s</em> full crossplay support will be available. On Thursday, Gearbox <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1517228560272003072\">also announced</a> an “all new <em>Tales from the Borderlands</em> adventure” that will be released in 2022.</p>",
