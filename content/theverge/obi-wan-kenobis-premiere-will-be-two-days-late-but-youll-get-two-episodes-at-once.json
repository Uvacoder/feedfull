The new schedule means you’ll be able to watch the show starting Friday, May 27th. </p><p id=\"HXzZZy\">The company announced the news on Thursday with a video featuring <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gEuirQWecEw\"><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em> star Ewan McGregor</a>. Disney first introduced Wednesday debuts <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421140/loki-disney-plus-show-new-date-wednesday\">with <em>Loki</em> in 2021</a> (also with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNyLzc3MU_E\">a video</a>, though this one featuring star Tom Hiddleston), and that move was apparently successful enough that the company soon moved the release dates for all of its original series <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538210/disney-plus-wednesday-friday-release-schedule-loki\">to Wednesdays</a>. Despite the shift for <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi’s</em> premiere, subsequent episodes will still debut on Wednesdays, <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/news/obi-wan-kenobi-may-27\">Disney says</a>.</p><p id=\"IfSTmf\"><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi </em>begins 10 years after the events of <em>Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith</em>, in which Anakin Skywalker completed his transformation into Darth Vader. Hayden Christensen is back to reprise his role as Vader, which I <em>cannot wait for</em> — the potential for memes is great. Disney debuted the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/obiwankenobi/status/1501630732619423744\">first teaser</a> for <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi </em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22927002/star-wars-obi-wan-kenobi-trailer-darth-vader-battle\">earlier this month</a>, and if you’re a Star Wars prequel trilogy stan like I am, it’s likely to send some nostalgic chills down your spine.</p>",
