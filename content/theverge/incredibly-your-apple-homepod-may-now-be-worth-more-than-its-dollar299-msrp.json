But now, it’s starting to make sense — not only are some people still willing to pay a premium for the somewhat smart speaker, they’re willing to pay <em>more than Apple charged for it</em>. </p><p id=\"8BMB54\">We took a look at eBay sales numbers after spotting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChanceHMiller/status/1516537846747828228\">9to5Mac editor-in-chief Chance Miller’s tweet</a>, and we soon discovered it wasn’t just a joke: on average, an Apple HomePod fetched $375 this past week. That’s 25 percent more than Apple charged. </p><p id=\"K4r1no\">Of course, some HomePods are worth more than others — a used speaker with no box might only net you $220 before eBay fees, but we’ve seen a few factory sealed non-refurbished HomePods sell for over $500. In fact, some sellers are boasting that they got Apple to replace their old HomePods with brand-new units just so they could flip them. </p><p id=\"iDJ8pu\">When I filtered out expensive sealed-box outliers, the average sale price was more like $350 this past week. That’s still $50 more than they cost brand-new!</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gcmCSGKg-8WI4RHazBxd241Oro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23402060/ebay_sales_homepod.jpg\">      <cite>eBay screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>Note that prices might dip if Verge readers flood the market.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"H5yL0E\">It’s subtle, but you can see in the eBay chart above that the value of a HomePod <em>has</em> been appreciating over the past year since it got discontinued. That’s practically unheard of for gadgets like these, save for scalping situations <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23031309/nvidia-amd-gpu-price-in-stock-retail-ebay\">like we’ve recently seen with consoles and GPUs</a>.</p><p id=\"Bq7iq0\">Why the HomePod? That’s a good question. It’s a piece of Apple history, perhaps; you need two of them for stereo or more for whole-home audio; and unlike its more affordable successor <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review\">the HomePod Mini</a>, it’s acoustically quite good. My colleague Jen Tuohy has also explained <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22704860/siri-best-smart-home-voice-assistant-editorial\">that the smart home is one of the few places where Siri actually excels</a>. She thinks people are realizing it’s the only other option besides the worse-sounding HomePod Mini. </p><p id=\"LcP2eF\">So that’s a working theory for now.</p><aside id=\"7wR5Nx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Yes, Siri is my favorite smart home controller and here’s why\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22704860/siri-best-smart-home-voice-assistant-editorial\"}]}'></div></aside>",
