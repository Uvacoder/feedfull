Take the latest version of the Microsoft Surface Pro 8, for instance, which <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgUXk8WgUxv\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you can currently grab in a high-end configuration at Best Buy for $1,299.99</a> instead of $1,599.99. This powerful tablet comes equipped with an 11th Gen Intel Core i5 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage that can be supplemented with SD cards if you need a little extra space. The 13-inch, 120Hz display on the Pro 8 also features 2880x1920 resolution but can also be paired with an external monitor, thanks to its pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports. It even has a 3.5mm audio jack if you’re still using headphones that plug into something, but keep in mind that you’ll have to purchase the detachable keyboard cover and stylus separately if you want to make the most of the Windows 11 machine. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"bchUjV\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10771697\"></div></div><p id=\"1TxDSo\">Another fine lightweight workhorse, this particular configuration of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 is currently discounted from its usual $699.99 price to $549.99 at both <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097WD9P4K/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgM0O19vqGU\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> in its fire-engine red colorway. The compact, 13-inch Chromebook features 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage out of the box but can be expanded with up to a terabyte of additional storage via a microSD card. While the laptop’s 10th Gen Intel Core i3 processor isn’t intended for much heavy lifting, it’s more than sufficient for running multiple apps in parallel on Google’s Chrome OS. Some other notable features include a pair of USB-C ports in addition to a 3.5mm audio jack, as well as a 1080p QLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"zel2z0\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11109103\"></div></div><aside id=\"LRzc0S\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"What’s the best student laptop? We asked students\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"5wOgTJ\">Although it usually sells for $129.99, <a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Feg10gam9901.html%3F&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup032822\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you can currently buy the Elgato Cam Link 4K for $99.99 at Adorama</a>. The price for this handy little dongle changes pretty regularly, but this is close to the best price we’ve seen for the device in recent months. It may look like it’s only available for full price, but don’t panic, as the discount will apply as soon as you view the item in your cart. If you’re not familiar with Elgato’s Cam Link 4K, the gadget allows you to convert just about any conventional DSLR, mirrorless, or action camera into a webcam for streaming, providing you with video quality that’s difficult to match. </p><div id=\"Zdwz2R\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10321671\"></div></div><p id=\"r2W5jr\">If you’re looking to pick up a second DualSense controller for your PlayStation 5, you can currently save $10 at checkout at Adorama if you opt for the standard, white colorway. The DualSense controller in either white or black typically costs $69.99, but the peripheral’s <a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fso3005715.html%3F&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup032822\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">current discount at Adorama drops the price to $59.99</a>, easily one of the controller’s best prices to date. The DualSense builds on Sony’s excellent DualShock controller design by adding adaptive tension and vibration to each trigger, providing you with more precise haptic feedback. Note that the price will appear unchanged until you put the accessory in your cart, so don’t worry if it appears to be full price on the landing page.</p><div id=\"LELntU\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10952578\"></div></div><aside id=\"jgprrA\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Sony reportedly plans to announce its Game Pass competitor next week\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/25/22996376/sony-playstation-spartacus-subscription-game-pass-rumor-ps5\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"QjJmXB\">Only available for its full price of $84.99 on Amazon, the latest iteration of the Echo Show 5 is <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgNrnVHRe4K\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently discounted to $44.99 at Best Buy</a>. The ubiquitous, 5-inch smart display is hardly a revelation when compared to its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previous model</a>, but its list of features still makes it the standard for screen-based smart hubs. The compact touchscreen is small enough to fit on your nightstand and is equipped with a surprisingly loud speaker. It’s also capable of streaming video and displaying a variety of customizable updates, including calendar alerts and weather forecasts, and is compatible with Amazon’s full suite of Alex features. And while you can technically use it for video calls thanks to its 2MP camera, the hub’s paltry camera and limited video calling options definitely remain shortcomings. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"2BJ9yq\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10609475\"></div></div><h2 id=\"uqAlx0\"><strong>Just a few more...</strong></h2><ul><li id=\"Fkmmea\">This month’s free game on the Epic Games Store is now live.
