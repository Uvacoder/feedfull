During the outage, Apple also warned that there were issues with Weather, Game Center, Apple Card, and the iCloud Web Apps, saying that they may be “slow or unavailable.” Those issues are also now marked as resolved. </p><p id=\"jA9ZsR\">During the outage, Apple Music worked for some <em>Verge</em> staff but not for others, and quite a few of us encountered issues trying to download apps or updates from the App Store. Usually, the progress circle would just spin continuously and then return to a download or update button after failing. Now, some Verge staff report that Apple Music is back up and running for them, and I was able to download around 30 app updates without any issues.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GCdVBivIJFni9pGsKZhe8168Nrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23338268/Screen_Shot_2022_03_22_at_15.56.04.png\">      <cite>Graph: DownDetector</cite>      <figcaption><em>The graph for the App Store is very similar.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"0azQeU\">Downdetector <a href=\"https://downdetector.com/status/app-store/\">backed up our experiences</a>, showing almost a thousand other people reporting issues with the Apple Store and Apple Music.
