It’s the second Staten Island Amazon warehouse to have a union election scheduled; workers at the company’s JFK8 facility — also seeking to be represented by the ALU— <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22937440/amazon-jfk8-staten-island-union-election-march-25th\">will begin voting on March 25th.</a></p><p id=\"OtpA1J\">According to <em>CNBC</em>, the LDJ5 vote will be in person, and the National Labor Relations Board will tally the results beginning May 2nd. </p><p id=\"MF9FOY\">It’s been a long road to this election for workers at LDJ5. The warehouse was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738310/amazon-warehouse-workers-staten-island-union-election-nlrb\">initially included</a> in a workers’ petition to the NLRB to hold elections at multiple Staten Island facilities, but the ALU <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850880/amazon-workers-staten-island-refile-union-petition\">withdrew that petition</a> so it could focus on JFK8. The union later <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914807/amazon-workers-warehouse-nyc-petition-nlrb-union-organize\">submitted a new petition</a> for LDJ5, which received <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/2/22959234/amazon-union-staten-island-ldj5-election-drive-nlrb-approval-go-ahead\">the go-ahead</a> from the NLRB earlier this month.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"qVjlO4\"><q>Amazon has been accused of illegally fighting unions</q></aside></div><p id=\"g0cnoy\">The NLRB has accused Amazon of various anti-union practices as the Staten Island facilities as workers began the steps to organize. The labor watchdog has brought cases against the company alleging that it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22905235/nlrb-amazon-broke-labor-laws-jfk8-warehouse-workers\">threatened, surveilled, and interrogated workers</a> involved with organization efforts and even <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22983692/nlrb-amazon-labor-activism-gerald-bryson-jfk8-warehouse-injunction\">fired one in retaliation</a> for his union activity. Amazon has disputed these accounts.</p><p id=\"o2yzs2\">The NLRB also found that Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive\">interfered with a union election last year in Bessemer, Alabama</a>, which led to it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878457/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-election-redo-february-fourth\">ordering a do-over</a>. The votes for the Bessemer election redo will be counted on March 28th, according to <em>CNBC</em>.</p><p id=\"0c5csP\">Amazon did not respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment Friday.</p>",
