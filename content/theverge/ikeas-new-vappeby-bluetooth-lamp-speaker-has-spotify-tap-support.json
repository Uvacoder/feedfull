It even comes with a USB-C cable to charge it, although it doesn’t include a wall brick. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wwl7uLVAb1AKqhwp9B8kLR8J3e8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23339680/VAPPEBY4_db623a9e_potm_desktop.png\">  </figure><p id=\"OvfUCU\">The most novel addition is support for Spotify Tap, which is making its Bluetooth speaker debut. Once you’ve set up Tap in the Spotify app, tapping (get it?) the power button on the Vappeby will automatically pick up Spotify playback from wherever you left off. Tapping it again will skip to a recommendation from Spotify’s algorithm based on your listening habits. </p><p id=\"RkGhbR\">Otherwise, though, the Vappeby doesn’t offer much in the way of smart features. The light is just a regular light, with no smart home integration with either <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/27/21722304/ikea-tradfri-home-smart-scene-firmware-shortcut-button-price-date\">Ikea’s Trådfri platform</a> or the broader Google / Apple / Amazon smart home systems. Spotify integration aside, the speaker is just a regular Bluetooth speaker, with no option to double as a power bank or any fancy pairing or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22872141/ikea-sonos-second-gen-symfonisk-bookshelf-speaker-update\">Sonos integrations</a>. </p><p id=\"hGV7cR\">The Ikea Vappeby is available in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fvappeby-bluetooth-speaker-lamp-outdoor-blue-40515276%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F23%2F22992775%2Fikea-vappeby-bluetooth-lamp-speaker-spotify-tap-support\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blue</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fvappeby-bluetooth-speaker-lamp-outdoor-gray-40515281%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F23%2F22992775%2Fikea-vappeby-bluetooth-lamp-speaker-spotify-tap-support\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gray</a> color schemes from Ikea’s website for $64.99</p><p id=\"dnGXoH\"></p>",
