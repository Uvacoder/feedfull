Its future remains a little bit unclear, with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917999/google-stadia-white-label-peloton-bungie-capcom\">Google reportedly putting less priority on it internally</a>. Though the service’s future <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22978719/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-free-trial\">may still carve out its niche among gamers seeking free demos and trials</a> that are easy to test out, what if you already subscribed but feel it’s time to step off <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel\">this beta-like ride</a>?</p><p id=\"MrVK5r\">The good news is that canceling a $9.99-per-month Google Stadia Pro subscription is fairly easy. </p><p id=\"SpGzhx\">However, you may already be thinking to yourself: “What’s going to happen to my games?” Here are the basics of what happens when you cancel Stadia Pro and fall back to a free-tier account:</p><ul><li id=\"lF3709\">You’ll lose access to any games that you claimed for free while a Stadia Pro member</li><li id=\"l3VE5x\">You can keep and continue playing any games that you purchased through the service</li><li id=\"HJSsOJ\">You’ll be limited to a 1080p stream with stereo sound instead of 4K and 5.1 surround</li></ul><p id=\"EQfh7M\">That makes sense — the games you bought with actual money won’t be trapped behind the paywall, and the “free” games work similarly to how PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Games with Gold do today.</p><p id=\"QiJwko\">Lapsed Stadia Pro subscribers can still purchase and play additional games, even on a free account. After all, Google wants you to keep using and paying for Stadia, in one way or another, though discounts on new games are an exclusive perk for paying Stadia Pro members. Also, if you later decide to resubscribe to Stadia Pro, the free games you initially claimed will be restored in your account’s library.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BmdYWcN709leFU6o9MRgNlofp3E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19376590/akrales_191113_3779_0010.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>One advantage of Stadia is the ability to play AAA-level games more modest hardware.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"09Xth4\">So if you decide to cancel, you can still continue using Google Stadia as a free service — playing the paid games you already own at a lower resolution and with the option to resubscribe at any time to jump back into your claimed free titles. And there isn’t too much risk in canceling your Pro account because you can always change your mind later if you miss it. </p><p id=\"P8Mqaq\">This post will run you through the cancellation process on your Chrome browser or through the Stadia mobile app.</p><h2 id=\"KkRn8N\">How to cancel from Chrome</h2><ul><li id=\"hPDij5\">Go to <a href=\"http://stadia.google.com\">stadia.google.com</a> and click your avatar on the top right corner of the Chrome browser screen.</li><li id=\"7AZ0x0\">In the drop-down menu, click <strong>Stadia settings</strong>.</li></ul>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-jzAYabW3Xpdv-aLOkdV15JUhk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19720510/stadia1.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>Accessing Stadia settings on a Chrome desktop browser.</em></figcaption>  </figure><ul><li id=\"M98H7J\">Next, hit <strong>Purchases &amp; subscriptions</strong>.</li></ul>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_juCO7PMtv0q_0gsHN5a5qna4kg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19720512/stadia2.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>Purchases &amp; subscriptions lists all your Stadia purchasing history and current subscription status.</em></figcaption>  </figure><ul><li id=\"UHOFhf\">On the next screen, you’ll see your purchases and subscriptions.
