It’s a slightly different story for the newer M1 Pro and M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pros, but any bit of savings you can get on the new Pro models is sure to be worthwhile.</p><p id=\"i5kEtb\">Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are still some lingering discounts available for older, Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1\">macOS Monterey</a> — but we strongly recommend opting for a newer model now that Apple has introduced its M1 chips across the MacBook Air and Pro lines. There is really no downside to opting for Apple’s own silicon, save for Windows Boot Camp holdouts.</p><p id=\"7QDx7u\">Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac%2F2020-mac-mini-macbook-air-macbook-pro&amp;subid1=vergemacbookdealsdecember2021\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s refurbished store</a> provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>. If you’re looking for a new model, however, these are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.</p><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"6Zmiyl\"><h2 id=\"SBa7t8\">Select a category</h2><ul><li id=\"G7eKsD\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals#EVXzol\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The best MacBook Air deals</a></li><li id=\"sczWsj\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals#DTHGG6\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The best MacBook Pro deals</a></li><li id=\"uvU72Z\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals#LYpjlZ\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The best Mac Mini deals</a></li></ul><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"TGmZTR\"><div id=\"wtaWNU\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10961031\"></div></div><h2 id=\"EVXzol\">The best MacBook Air deals </h2><p id=\"FJU3RG\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MacBook Air</a> is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s currently our top pick for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best laptop you can buy</a>.</p><div id=\"iF2kto\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9737407\"></div></div><p id=\"LZawtk\">The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, although in the past few months we’ve seen it discounted down to $799.99. The best deal on the base model at the moment, however, is at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5KWB9H/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmgn93lla.html&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup030122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adorama</a>, where it’s on sale in select colorways for $949.

The M1-powered MacBook Pro of 2020 remains the final Touch Bar holdout. It is a sibling to the MacBook Air, introduced at the same time, with similar innards, save mostly for a fan that allows it to run at peak performance for longer. The new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced in October</a>, however, come with the M1 Pro or optional M1 Max CPUs.</p><p id=\"sZGYTd\">Right now, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgQPGp6bhR1\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-14-inch-8%E2%80%91core-14%E2%80%91core/dp/B09JQSLL92/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon are offering a $250 discount</a> on the 14-inch, M1 Pro-equipped base model, selling it in space gray for $1,749, an all-time low. Both retailers are also selling the silver, 1TB configuration with 16GB of RAM, a 10-core CPU, and 16-core GPU for $2,249.99 instead of $2,499.95 (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-14-inch-8%E2%80%91core-14%E2%80%91core/dp/B09JQWSQK7/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgQPHg1ifhX\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>).

Whether it was the beautiful display or the remarkable performance and battery life they exhibited, these premium laptops are investments that we can wholeheartedly recommend.
