It’s a slightly different story for the newer MacBook Pros with the beefier M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs, but any bit of savings you can get on the new Pro models is sure to be worthwhile.</p><p id=\"i5kEtb\">Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBooks, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are still some lingering discounts available for older, Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1\">macOS Monterey</a> — but we strongly recommend opting for a newer model now that Apple has introduced its M1 chips across the MacBook Air and Pro lines. There is really no downside to opting for Apple’s own silicon, save for Windows Boot Camp holdouts.</p><p id=\"7QDx7u\">Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac%2F2020-mac-mini-macbook-air-macbook-pro&amp;subid1=vergemacbookdealsdecember2021\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s refurbished store</a> provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>. If you’re looking for a new model, however, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.</p><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"6Zmiyl\"><h2 id=\"SBa7t8\">Select a category</h2><ul><li id=\"G7eKsD\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals#EVXzol\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The best MacBook Air deals</a></li><li id=\"sczWsj\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals#DTHGG6\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The best MacBook Pro deals</a></li><li id=\"uvU72Z\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals#LYpjlZ\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The best Mac Mini deals</a></li></ul><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"TGmZTR\"><div id=\"wtaWNU\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10961031\"></div></div><h2 id=\"EVXzol\">The best MacBook Air deals </h2><p id=\"FJU3RG\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MacBook Air</a> is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s currently our top pick for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best laptop you can buy</a>.</p><div id=\"iF2kto\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9737407\"></div></div><p id=\"LZawtk\">The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999, although in the past few months, we’ve seen it discounted as low as $799.99. The best deal on the base model at the moment, however, is for $949 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmgn93lla.html&amp;subid1=VergeDealsRoundup040622\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adorama</a>, and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604825-REG%2Fapple_mgn63ll_a_13_3_macbook_air_with.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>.

The M1-powered MacBook Pro of 2020 remains the final Touch Bar holdout. It is a sibling to the MacBook Air, introduced at the same time, with similar innards, save mostly for a fan that allows it to run at peak performance for longer. The new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced in October</a>, however, come with the M1 Pro or optional M1 Max CPUs.</p><p id=\"sZGYTd\">Right now, Costco has the lone $50 discount on the 14-inch, M1 Pro-equipped base model, <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/new-macbook-pro-(14-inch)---apple-m1-pro-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-14-core-gpu%2c-512gb-ssd.product.100713178.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">selling it in silver or space gray for $1,949.99</a>. It may not be an especially good discount, but if you need a 14-inch MacBook Pro with an upgraded 1TB of storage, 16GB of RAM, a 10-core CPU, and a 16-core GPU, it will run you for $2,449 instead of $2,499 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-14-inch-8%E2%80%91core-14%E2%80%91core/dp/B09JQQM86S?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> — a similar $50 off.

Whether it was the beautiful display or the remarkable performance and battery life they exhibited, these premium laptops are investments that we can wholeheartedly recommend. As soon as there’s a steep price break on these impressive laptops, we’d suggest that anyone in the market for a new laptop consider purchasing one, as they’re likely to sell out fast. </p><div id=\"oXGxIx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10814206\"></div></div><div id=\"AOJENT\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10814228\"></div></div><aside id=\"yZsqJo\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"2021 MacBook Pros compared: how Apple’s laptops stack up\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733406/macbook-pro-13-14-16-inch-m1-max-air-compare-specs\"},{\"title\":\"12 great apps ready for your new Mac\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22814365/mac-best-apps-apple-2021\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"JByVWG\">The Touch Bar-equipped, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">13-inch MacBook Pro</a> is similar to the Air but geared toward slightly more demanding use cases and starts at $1,299. The M1-powered base model includes 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads.</p><p id=\"x8c54h\">In December, we saw the base model drop to $1,099.99 at Amazon, but right now, the best available price is at Amazon, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5LLDSG?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">which is selling the silver model for $1,149.99</a>.

It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6.</p><p id=\"O9PC7b\">Like the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Mini features Apple’s M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations.

The new Mac Studio may be getting all the headlines, but that’s a much pricier machine. The little M1 Mac Mini is still a very capable desktop for everyday users who dabble in some creative work, though the $30 discount at this time is quite modest.</p><div id=\"RPnQwi\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9712859\"></div></div><aside id=\"APBdOd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
