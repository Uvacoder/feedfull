While the pauses probably won’t make it that much harder to get a muscle car, they are just the latest in a string of automotive delays caused by shortages of chips and other supplies.</p><p id=\"EJFPvE\"><a href=\"https://www.wxyz.com/money/auto-news/ford-pausing-production-at-flat-rock-assembly-next-week-due-to-chip-shortage\">According to <em>WXYZ Detroit</em></a>, Ford is explicitly citing the chip shortage as the reason it’s not producing cars at its <a href=\"https://corporate.ford.com/operations/locations/global-plants/flat-rock-assembly-plant.html\">Flat Rock assembly plant</a> where Mustangs are made. This isn’t the first time the company has struggled with supply issues — it’s had to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage\">cut back</a> on the production of the F-150 and other vehicles <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/04/chip-shortage-forces-ford-to-cut-production-of-f-150-bronco-suv.html\">multiple times</a>, and earlier this year, it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/13/22975246/ford-ship-sell-incomplete-vehicles-missing-chips\">started selling Explorers</a> that were missing minor features, reportedly due to a lack of chips.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"WKu5Tm\"><q>The chip shortage isn’t going to go away overnight</q></aside></div><p id=\"WMPqLp\">General Motors, Chevy’s parent company, has had similar problems, though <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/ford-mustang-chevrolet-camaro-production-suspended\"><em>Fox Business</em> says</a> the company didn’t comment on exactly why it was pausing production at its <a href=\"https://plants.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/assembly/lgr.html\">Lansing Grand River facility</a> responsible for making the Camaro and Cadillac CT4 / CT5. Last year, the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654357/gm-factory-shutdown-chip-shortage-truck-suv\">had to shut down six of its US-based plants</a> and dropped features like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage\">wireless charging</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions\">gas-saving Active Fuel Management systems</a> from some of its vehicles. It even blamed the shortages for the dip in sales that handed Toyota the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867285/gm-toyota-us-top-selling-automaker-chip-shortage\">“top seller of vehicles in the US” crown</a> that GM had held for almost a century. </p><p id=\"pqTibs\">Ford and GM would obviously rather not have to shutter their factories and have taken steps to improve the situation — late last year, they <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789413/ford-gm-chip-shortage-globalfoundries-qualcomm-tsmc\">both announced partnerships with chipmakers</a>. But designing your own chips or changing manufacturing are projects that could take years, and any company that touches technology is fighting to get semiconductors right now.</p><p id=\"8qdwls\">Other automakers have also been affected by the supply chain stresses of both a pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Just within the past two months, BMW has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/bmw-resume-production-some-plants-2022-03-09/\">halted production at some of its German factories</a>, Tesla <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/3/23008668/tesla-shanghai-factory-closed-lockdown-covid-china\">had its Shanghai factory closed by COVID</a> restrictions, and Nissan <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/nissan-ariya-ev-suv-japanese-launch-delayed-chip-shortage/?PostType=link&amp;TheTime=2022-04-05T19%3A56%3A39&amp;UniqueID=81B201E4-B51A-11EC-8C95-97413A982C1E&amp;ServiceType=twitter&amp;ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b\">delayed a wider launch</a> of its Ariya EV in Japan thanks to the chip shortage. <a href=\"https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/volvo-cuts-swedish-production-chip-shortage\">Volvo</a> and <a href=\"https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/toyota-forced-make-deeper-production-cuts-due-chip-shortage\">Toyota</a> have also had to make production cuts.</p><p id=\"C80MYM\">Of course, as automakers struggle with production, it’s become harder for consumers to buy cars as well. New cars, <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/buying-a-car/global-chip-shortage-makes-it-tough-to-buy-certain-cars-a8160576456/\">when they’re available</a>, have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales\">gotten more expensive</a>, and some used cars are even <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22923871/carvana-pandemic-used-car-prices-sold-online-chip-shortage\">being sold for more than they cost new</a>. </p>",
