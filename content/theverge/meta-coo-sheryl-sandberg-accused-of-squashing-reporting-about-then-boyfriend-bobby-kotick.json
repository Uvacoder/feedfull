On both occasions, the story did not run. Now, Facebook is investigating the issue to see if Sandberg potentially violated company policy. </p><p id=\"erHuU7\">According to sources in the <em>WSJ</em> report, Kotick said that Sandberg threatened the <em>Mail</em> in 2016, stating that any article published about the restraining order could damage the publication’s relationship with Facebook. Kotick denied this, telling the <em>Journal</em>, “I never said anything like that.”</p><p id=\"4lRpb8\">In 2019, when the <em>Mail</em> was again looking to publish a story about the incident, Sandberg emailed the chairman of the <em>Mail</em>’s parent company, who referred her to the publication’s then editor in chief, Martin Clarke, according to the <em>WSJ </em>story. The two exchanged emails and, once again, the story did not run. It is important to note that, according to the <em>Journal</em>, sources at the <em>Mail</em> who were in communication with Sandberg said they did not feel threatened.</p><p id=\"Ms1Cfj\">Sandberg has a reputation for being a champion for women’s rights in the workplace, penning the 2013 book <em>Lean In</em> and founding the <a href=\"https://leanin.org/\">LeanIn.org</a> nonprofit foundation. Bobby Kotick’s reputation, however, has suffered greatly in the wake of accusations that he <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations\">covered up or ignored the workplace harassment</a> at the heart of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action\">multiple lawsuits against his company, Activision Blizzard</a>. In court documents related to the restraining order, the <em>WSJ </em>reports that Kotick allegedly showed up uninvited to his then-girlfriend’s house in March 2014 and tried to gain entry after she told him their relationship was over because of his “bullying and controlling nature.” </p><p id=\"y7uOxt\">In a statement to the <em>Journal,</em> a Meta spokeswoman said, “Sheryl Sandberg never threatened the MailOnline’s business relationship with Facebook in order to influence an editorial decision.”</p><p id=\"HA9Kbh\">Facebook didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p id=\"NHEmkM\"></p>",
