The conference is a hub for developers looking to network, but the rest of us are watching to see if Google will unveil new product announcements and major updates. </p><p id=\"6n7Nu5\">We don’t know <em>exactly </em>what’s going to be announced this year, but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/9/23063318/google-io-2022-rumors-announcements-android-13-pixel-watch-6a-keynote\">we have some good guesses</a>. Some of those guesses include a new Pixel Watch and a midrange Pixel 6A, which could include a new processor and camera sensor and major updates for Android 13, whose beta <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/26/23042395/android-13-public-beta-media-file-permissions-error-reporting-audio-routing\">became available to Pixel owners</a> in April. </p><h2 id=\"qdXzDG\">What time does Google I/O start?  </h2><p id=\"Yre3Ez\">Google I/O’s main keynote will be streamed today, Wednesday, May 11th, at 10AM PT / 1PM ET.
