The interface for controlling what’s currently playing has a similar layout to Spotify’s regular mode, which should let you use muscle memory (without a lot of the visual distractions that are on the standard screen).</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6n6Ew-jOVVSAYlUy8x5igKD8Afs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23342987/Screen_Shot_2022_03_24_at_11.33.41.png\">      <cite>Image: <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/03/24/spotify-test-drive-car-mode/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>9to5Google</em></a></cite>      <figcaption>9to5Google<em>’s screenshots from the Car Mode test.</em></figcaption>  </figure>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LEMlE4lxTVFVmPGwDwlWWMbcJdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23342991/IMAGE_2022_03_24_11_36_17.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>Spotify’s current non-Car Mode interface for controlling music..</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"g5JHCf\">The similarity to the regular interface solves a problem that some users had with the previous Car View — when <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/26/22803670/spotify-retiring-car-view-android-mobile-playback-auto-driving\">Spotify “retired” it</a>, many commenters wished it good riddance, saying it required more of their attention to use since it was so unfamiliar. </p><p id=\"t9HbGk\">The test doesn’t seem to be available for everyone. When I opened Spotify on my Pixel 2 while connected to my car’s Bluetooth, the app asked if I was in a car and if I wanted to open Google Maps. Otherwise, the interface stayed the same. Spotify on my iPhone seemed to use the same interface it did when I tested it in November. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVR4gBN89aJeIvvJCgz05-z8V0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23343003/2022_03_24_11.37.12.jpg\">      <figcaption><em>The interface remains unchanged for people who aren't asked via a pop-up to join the test.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"YgDWnU\">Spotify didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment on its testing plans and when (or if) it expected to roll Car Mode out to more users. Hopefully, it’ll become part of the app eventually — unfortunately, drivers will inevitably use their phones to control their music while driving, and that experience should be as fast as possible (without having to shell out $90 for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/22/22945403/spotify-car-thing-price-release-date\">Spotify’s Car Thing hardware</a>).</p>",
