Similar to pinned tweets on Twitter or pinned videos on TikTok, highlighting individual Instagram posts at the top of a profile would allow creators to draw attention to content without asking followers to scroll down through past posts to look for it.</p><p id=\"C5606q\">Meta confirmed to <em>TechCrunch </em>that it’s testing a new feature that lets users “feature posts on their profile.” It appears the feature has been in the works for a few months, having <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1487234696270557192\">been spotted</a> in January by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, as <em>TechCrunch</em> notes.</p><p id=\"b4FURr\">Instagram already allows users to create story highlights that appear above profile grids, and creators often use the feature to organize popular content like Q&amp;As, resources, event highlights, and more. </p><p id=\"Ri8kzO\">If rolled out beyond the test, it’s easy to imagine pinned posts could include popular content as well as become a new type of digital ad space for influencers working with brands to create sponsored content. </p>",
