The news comes in the wake of Charlie Cox reprising his role as Daredevil in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834061/spider-man-no-way-home-review-tom-holland-marvel-multiverse\"><em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em></a> and all of Netflix’s Marvel shows migrating over to Disney Plus earlier this year. While there’s currently no word on whether this new series will directly address the events of the Netflix series, it stands to reason that it would given Vincent D’Onofrio’s reprisal of his Kingpin role for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22849870/hawkeye-season-1-review-disney-plus\">Disney Plus’ <em>Hawkeye</em></a>.</p><p id=\"F2iRNO\">Now that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23054770/doctor-strange-2-review\">the multiverse has been breached</a>, Marvel’s in a position to easily weave basically all of its recent stories into the MCU no fuss no muss. A new <em>Daredevil </em>series raises the obvious question of whether Marvel’s considering reviving all of the old Netflix projects and just who all might come back. </p>",
