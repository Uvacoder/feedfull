The company’s analysis showed that when Verizon <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available\">turned on its C-band equipment</a> in January, its average 5G speeds jumped — and where carriers have their new tech rolled out, they’re all achieving similar speeds.</p><p id=\"FuLJBV\">When looking at the average 5G download speeds for each carrier, there’s a clear bump in Verizon’s numbers after the carrier <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891284/verizon-c-band-5g-ultra-wideband-now-available\">took its C-band equipment online in January</a>. The increased speeds that were available to customers in the rollout area brought its average up by around 15 megabits per second, according to Opensignal. Despite also rolling out C-band, AT&amp;T didn’t see the same bump — likely because its launch only covered “eight metro areas,” <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891286/att-5g-rollout-select-metro-areas-faa-delay\">according to the carrier</a> (though it promises to expand throughout 2022).</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mVPSMrW2T6jzKwhmiD7_zO3IWZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23353396/Screen_Shot_2022_03_29_at_11.36.46.png\">      <cite>Chart: Opensignal</cite>      <figcaption><em>There was a noticeable shift when Verizon turned on its C-band network.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"AwBpvl\">T-Mobile is, of course, notably ahead. That’s because Opensignal’s average speeds account both for those with fast mid-band and those without. In January, Verizon said that over 100 million people would have access to its C-band service. T-Mobile said mid-band covered <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/t-mobile-keeps-adding-phone-home-internet-subscribers-as-it-continues-5g-lead/\">over 210 million at that time</a>, which obviously helps its average numbers significantly — there are fewer people without mid-band coverage, bringing the average speeds down.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dCNikAIVsShh49u8vQSZkOJ7M0Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23353409/Screen_Shot_2022_03_29_at_11.41.30.png\">      <cite>Chart: Opensignal</cite>      <figcaption><em>Verizon and AT&amp;T look much more competitive in places where mid-band is rolled out.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"EwrYCv\">When Opensignal narrowed the scope to just mid-band 5G download speeds, though, the speed differences between carriers became much smaller. T-Mobile is still on top, with its more mature network delivering 225.5 Mbps on average, but Verizon’s C-band isn’t too far off at 211.8 Mbps. AT&amp;T is a bit further behind, only averaging around 160 Mbps, even on C-band. AT&amp;T and T-Mobile’s average upload speeds are in the 18 Mbps range, while Verizon pulls out ahead, averaging almost 21 Mbps. Those are significant improvements over what the average AT&amp;T or Verizon customer <a href=\"https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2022/01/usa/mobile-network-experience-5g\">was getting before their C-band rollouts</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EpSEcWXq7akO6B76OS4B3MEiuFg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23353422/Screen_Shot_2022_03_29_at_11.46.34.png\">      <cite>Image: Opensignal</cite>      <figcaption><em>The average download speeds for each carrier before the C-band rollout, for comparison.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"SgN83E\">While T-Mobile’s 5G rollout has been based around mid-band 5G, its competitors <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile\">spent billions</a> to get rights <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/15/22885320/att-dish-tmobile-5g-spectrum-billions-auction\">to the C-band spectrum</a> so they could do their own wide rollouts. In January, they actually started the process of broadcasting mid-band signals to consumers (after several delays due to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891634/faa-att-verizon-5g-c-band-rollout-battle-airlines-buffer-zones\">a brouhaha</a> around the possibility that C-band signals could interfere with vital equipment on airplanes). </p><p id=\"9eqRUc\">What this all means is that T-Mobile probably won’t be able to rest on its laurels. Verizon and, to a lesser extent, AT&amp;T have shown that their C-band acquisitions let them compete on speed where they’ve rolled out the equipment. Verizon <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-provide-5g-ultra-wideband-service-more-cities-year\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">is planning</a> on expanding its C-band availability to at least 75 million more people by the end of this year, whereas T-Mobile only plans on <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/t-mobile-keeps-adding-phone-home-internet-subscribers-as-it-continues-5g-lead/\">adding around 50 million more</a>. Sooner or later, Verizon may catch up, and the carriers will once again have to race for some way to differentiate themselves that they can brag about.</p>",
