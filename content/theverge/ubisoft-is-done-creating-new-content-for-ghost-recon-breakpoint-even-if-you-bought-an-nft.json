Ubisoft Quartz reflects this ambition and represents an incredible opportunity to learn with our community about what decentralization can bring to gaming. As the last <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em> Digit was released on March 17, we will now look to continue our exploration by improving the value proposition of the platform with new projects and features.”</p><p id=\"rEUS4o\">There are no new NFTs available, according to the Quartz website, though you can still browse resale marketplaces on <a href=\"https://objkt.com/collection/ubisoftquartz\">Objkt</a> and <a href=\"https://rarible.com/ubisoft-quartz/items\">Rarible</a>. It’s unclear if the <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em> NFTs will be transferrable to future games in some way — though, as far as I know, Ubisoft has never promised this would be the case. </p><p id=\"Nj6I8z\">If they don’t transfer, that means people who may have paid a good amount of money for one of the digital collectibles are stuck owning it in just one game that is no longer getting new content from the developer — much like what happens with more traditional virtual gaming gear when a game shuts down. That might sting for those who picked up an NFT at a high price; I saw that one Digit was purchased in late March on Rarible for 100 Tezos, which is currently equivalent to about $330.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"5DOcLG\"><q>Ubisoft is still hiring for blockchain-related jobs</q></aside></div><p id=\"7JvT3p\">People who hold NFTs for the recently shut down Formula 1 NFT racing game <em>F1 Delta Time</em>, one of which was valued at about <a href=\"https://www.animocabrands.com/f1dt-car-event-sell-usd20700000\">$265,000 at auction last year</a>, are perhaps in a worse position since the game has been shut down entirely. However, the developer of that game has <a href=\"https://revvmotorsport.medium.com/f1-delta-time-to-cease-operations-announces-rewards-for-supporters-2fbf307fe89f\">laid out</a> a few options for current NFT holders, including, in some cases, the ability to swap the NFTs for “proxy assets” that can be used to “obtain NFTs for products across the REVV Motorsport ecosystem” in the future.</p><p id=\"8rXY9p\">According <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/ghost-recon-breakpoint-frontline-nft-scam-battle-royale-1848756782\">to a <em>Kotaku </em>report about a new <em>Ghost Recon</em></a>, Ubisoft’s Quartz team has “gone mostly quiet internally,” though a spokesperson told the publication that Ubisoft will “have more to share regarding Ubisoft Quartz at a later date.” <em>Kotaku</em> also observed that Ubisoft is currently hiring for blockchain-related jobs. </p>",
