This restock is live now and is available to everyone, not just <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cf17AZjAf3K?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22536025%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TotalTech</a> subscribers, and is still likely to sell out extremely fast.</p><p id=\"b95VoV\">As always, to better your chances at grabbing one of these consoles, make sure to log into your Best Buy account in another browser tab while you wait in line, and make sure all your personal info, including billing and shipping addresses, are up to date. Once you’ve done that, it's simply a matter of waiting in line and playing the waiting game. Once you’ve hit the “Add to Cart” button you are placed in the queue, so there's no need to refresh the page. Just be prepared to verify your account while you wait.</p><p id=\"ZExLtz\">We don’t recommend add it to your cart in multiple tabs in an attempt to improve your odds, as Best Buy’s queue system tends to get a little confused when you do so. You should, however, keep your phone handy and logged into the Best Buy app in case your PC or laptop gives you any issues.</p><div id=\"4JhmCt\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10971440\"></div></div><p id=\"X6w6YW\">While proper preparation can certainly help, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee that you’ll be able to get a console. If you don’t get one today, remember that persistence is key, a number of staffers at <em>The Verge</em> have managed to get their hands on a PS5 through the same methods we’ve outlined here, so keep at it. Even if you strike out today, remember, we’re always keeping track of restocks at Best Buy and other retailers too, so make sure to check back regularly for updates.</p><aside id=\"XyY5YF\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Why the PS5 paywall isn’t worthwhile at Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription\"},{\"title\":\"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review\"}]}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"MWcsCA\">Some must-have PS5 accessories and games</h2><p id=\"faigOH\">Regardless if you’re one of the lucky shoppers to get a PS5 today, games and accessories for the console are almost always available, and in some cases, are even available at a discount.</p><div id=\"ZWwXIZ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10687661\"></div></div><div id=\"AVXQeT\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10759065\"></div></div><div id=\"jtn547\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10905923\"></div></div><div id=\"VXrHEx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10929247\"></div></div><aside id=\"C41xyo\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Where to preorder the colorful new PS5 covers and DualSense controllers\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22865349/ps5-playstation-5-console-covers-where-buy-dualsense-controllers-colors-price-preorder\"},{\"title\":\"Here are the accessories you’ll need for your new PlayStation 5\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21550907/ps5-wireless-controller-ssd-hard-drive-accessories-sony\"}]}'></div></aside><aside id=\"lRx1Gd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside><p id=\"EnycSG\"></p><p id=\"GQzhlU\"></p>",
