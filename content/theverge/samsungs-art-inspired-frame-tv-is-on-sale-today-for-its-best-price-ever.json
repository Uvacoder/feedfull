Typically $1,499.99, <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8532386-13142092?sid=TheVergeDailyDealsMarch262022&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-ls03a-frame-series-4k-smart-tv-new-55-or-65z-3\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Woot is selling the HDR-compatible, 55-inch QLED TV for $899.99</a>, which is $100 cheaper than the previous low we saw during Black Friday and in the run-up to the Super Bowl. The 65-inch model is also <a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8532386-13142092?sid=TheVergeDailyDealsMarch262022&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-ls03a-frame-series-4k-smart-tv-new-55-or-65z-3\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on sale for $1,399.99</a> instead of $1,999, and both TVs come with a one-year warranty from Samsung.</p><p id=\"m_-2211240195504554154Sq3UrL\">While the 2021 model lacks the matte, anti-reflective display found on this year’s model, they’re both designed to display artwork when not in use, allowing them to blend in more easily with your home’s decor. When turned on, they function as Alexa-equipped, 4K TVs that support a 120Hz refresh rate and a healthy selection of streaming apps.</p><div id=\"KbRjlc\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10819823\"></div></div><p id=\"2KWGv4\">If smart lighting is more your thing, Philips Hue is currently taking 15 percent off a range of popular smart bulbs, ambient light strips, lamps, and other items <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/promotions/room-bundles\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">listed on this landing page</a> as part of its mix and match sale. To get the discount, you’ll need to buy at least one product from three categories: bulbs, ambiance, and accessories. The 15 percent discount will then be applied automatically, so long as you make your purchase before April 5th.</p><p id=\"yx8xO5\">Right now, for instance, you could bundle <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-2-pack-e26/046677563363\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two 75W white and color E26 smart bulbs</a> (normally $89.99) with a <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-bridge/046677458478\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hue Bridge</a> (normally $59.99), an optional accessory that allows you to set lighting routines, control varied scenes, and connect up to 50 lights. You could then throw in an <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-gradient-lightstrip-80-inch/046677570552\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">80-inch Gradient Lightstrip</a> and get all four items for about $280, which roughly equates to a $50 discount.</p><p id=\"uUxvyE\">Combined, that means you can add some pretty cool smart lighting throughout your home for a little less. You can use the smart bulbs to set different hues of white light ranging from warmer to cooler, and further customize them with adjustable smart timers. The Gradient Lightstrips, meanwhile, are capable of displaying an array of colors at the same time, so you can add a touch of color behind your monitor if you were to mount one behind your desk. You can also pair the bulbs and Lightstrip with your existing setup via the Hue Bridge, which uses the Zigbee protocol, thus allowing you to control it all with the most popular smart home ecosystems, including Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, and Amazon’s Alexa.</p><div id=\"BsmetI\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10649409\"></div></div><div id=\"title\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11067691\"></div></div><div id=\"pJ1UBt\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11114133\"></div></div><aside id=\"jiXy7R\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Philips Hue adds a whole bunch of new lights, including a ‘light tube’ \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22650951/hue-light-tube-gradient-filament-brighter-bulbs\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"fmVZxy\">We consider the powerful LG Gram 17 the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">best laptop for fans of big screens</a>, namely because it offers a large, 17-inch screen yet remains surprisingly lightweight. In fact, despite its massive display, we found it to be only a little bit heavier than the 13-inch MacBook Air. We also liked that the laptop offers quiet operation, 12 hours of battery life, and a great keyboard, one that’s a joy to type on and provides a surprising amount of travel.</p><p id=\"4WGZur\">Normally $1,949.99, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgTGIVui7rk\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy is currently selling</a> the configuration with 16GB of RAM, a 2TB SSD, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, and an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 Evo processor for $1,499.99 — the best price we’ve seen for this particular configuration — as a part of the store’s one-day sale on various LG products. That makes the Windows 11 machine more affordable than the model we tested last year, which offered a 1TB SSD and initially retailed for $1,799.99. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"BMifkr\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10498451\"></div></div><p id=\"m_-4667645334367285399AD3GbY\">Apple’s most affordable iPad just became, well, more affordable for a limited time.

It also comes with a 12MP ultrawide front-facing camera with support for Apple’s Center Stage feature — which is designed to keep you centered in the frame during video calls — as well as a 10.2-inch True Tone display that adjusts the color temperature based on your environment.

We found the earbuds offer excellent voice quality and improved battery life in comparison to their predecessor, though, we wished they were able to connect to two devices simultaneously like other Jabra earbuds. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22811826/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-review-features-multipoint\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></li><li id=\"Ej86Ht\">Looking for something to watch this weekend?
