And then I remind you that the game in question looked like this:</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6eWlt-8PhFCDS7JukVIztRSalWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23345680/Colossal_Cave_Adventure_on_VT100_terminal.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure#/media/File:Colossal_Cave_Adventure_on_VT100_terminal.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Autopilot</a> (Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0)</cite>      <figcaption><em>Colossal Cave Adventure running on a PDP-11/34 with a monitor.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"iftsWw\">And then I remind you that Roberta and Ken have been retired for the past 25 years. </p><p id=\"Lmt832\">And <em>then</em> I remind you that — while Roberta and Ken made <em>King’s Quest</em> and <em>Phantasmagoria</em> AND are credited with the first graphical adventure game <em>ever</em> in <em>Mystery Quest </em>AND founded storied game company Sierra, which published everything from <em>The Incredible Machine </em>to <em>Leisure Suit Larry </em>to <em>Half-Life</em> — they weren’t actually involved with <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em>, aka <em>Adventure</em>, aka <em>Advent</em>. It was simply the game that inspired them. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7PHdpdVMUQaAr-jWTse6BdfzsoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23345782/kenrobertasierra_1647841397707.jpeg\">      <cite>Photo via Cygnus Entertainment</cite>      <figcaption><em>Ken and Roberta Williams in the early Sierra days.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"mf7bkQ\">So this is a remarkable turn of events, to say the least, spanning almost 50 years of video game history from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text-based_computer_games\">games you originally played on mainframes</a> all the way to the Oculus Quest 2, history in which Roberta and Ken played important roles. But why? “Ken was bored, and I suggested he <a href=\"https://kensbook.com/\">write a book</a> about Sierra. The process of writing the book brought back long-forgotten memories resulting in Ken deciding to learn Unity and deciding to make a game,” Roberta Williams <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/sierra-founders-got-bored-in-lockdown-so-theyre-making-their-first-new-game-in-more-than-20-years/\">explained to <em>PC Gamer</em></a>.</p><p id=\"9n0CTY\">I would say that I have no idea what to expect — if their new company Cygnus Entertainment hadn’t already released a graphically barebones trailer that you can watch right here:</p><div id=\"nENWLH\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qpHj186rMX4?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"kKPPBe\">Cygnus currently has 12 full-time employees working on the game. “It has not yet been determined whether future games will be developed by Cygnus Entertainment LLC or if Colossal Cave 3D was a one-shot effort. Time will tell,” <a href=\"https://www.colossalcave3d.com/about-cygnus\">reads the new company’s website</a>. </p><p id=\"irFS3c\">If you’re not familiar with Ken and Roberta Williams’ seminal work, one of their former employees who goes by Metal Jesus on YouTube just sat down with them for an extensive retrospective last week. I’d highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAemLilaNjk\">giving it a watch</a>:</p><div id=\"PEiZP5\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAemLilaNjk?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"unK4F6\">And if you want to try the original <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em> (which <a href=\"https://killscreen.com/previously/articles/rediscovered-mainframe-game-from-1974-might-first-text-adventure/\">may not technically be</a> the first text adventure game), you can <a href=\"http://rickadams.org/adventure/advent/\">play it on the web right here</a>.</p><p id=\"UoLF3T\">Thank you for all the games, Roberta and Ken. I grew up with <em>King’s Quest</em> and <em>Dr. Brain</em> and <em>Quest for Glory</em> and many, many more, and I probably wouldn’t be here if not for them.</p>",
