The <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/dt/corporate/newsroom/announcements/detailpage.press-releases~usa~2022~03~31032022-dell-technologies-elevates-the-hybrid-work-experience.htm#/filter-on/Country:en-us\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dual Charge Dock</a> can provide 90W to your computer over USB-C and 12W of power to your phone via the fabric-covered wireless charger.</p><p id=\"p1GifD\">In a press release, Dell says that the charging coils in the Qi portion of the dock are widely spread out — meaning that you can charge your phone while it’s in portrait or landscape, and you can even use the charger to juice up a pair of wireless earbuds.</p><p id=\"rzPkEh\">Of course, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc31L3zJiaU\">as a dock</a>, it’s also meant to let you plonk your laptop down on a desk, plug in a single cable, and be able to use external displays and peripherals. To that end, it’s got a decent selection of ports — four USB-A ports, one USB-C port (in addition to the USB-C cable you use to connect the dock to your laptop), an ethernet jack, HDMI 2.1, and DisplayPort 1.4 ports. That USB-C port can also supply 15W of power if you’ve got a device that you have to charge with a cable. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UNKBcjMvUyXbOyeL8v39cqxqWBY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23358048/openpublicdocument.do_2.jpeg\">      <cite>Image: Dell</cite>      <figcaption><em>There’s also a USB-C port on the other side.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"4UfDzC\">The Dual Charge Dock isn’t cheap — it’ll cost $368.99 when it becomes available on May 12th. For that price, you could pick up <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Docking-PowerExpand-Charging-Ethernet/dp/B088F7SY6S?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this Anker Dock</a> (which has a similar port selection <em>and</em> SD card slots), <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-US\">a Pixel Stand</a>, and one <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samyang-Ramen-Chicken-Roasted-Noodles/dp/B00P0ILI3K/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">inexpensive but satisfying lunch</a>. If you’re on a budget, you could take a look at this <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cyber-acoustics-essential-ds-2000-dual-4k-docking-station-w-90-watts-power-delivery/apd/ab341043/pc-accessories\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$125 dock / laptop cooler</a> Dell sells on its website, get <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a standard Qi charging pad</a> to go with it, and have over $200 leftover.</p><p id=\"q0QNZN\">None of that says that the dock is overpriced or that nobody should buy it. I can absolutely see the value of having a compact, all-in-one charging solution that also adds a good number of ports to your laptop. I won’t be surprised if I see <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22340755/whats-on-your-desk-setup-tech-verge\">a few desks</a> with the Dual Charge Dock on them in the near future. </p><p id=\"lZu9yS\">PS — if you prefer Thunderbolt, Dell’s also got a Thunderbolt 4 dock coming out in “Q2” for $469.99. It features fewer USB-A ports (and doesn’t have an integrated Qi charger) but does have Thunderbolt passthrough and more display outputs.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1ueny-AWZQbSCTl4gUqsaYVu4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23358041/Thunderbolt_Dock_WD22TB4_3_.jpeg\">      <cite>Image: Dell</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Thunderbolt dock is more expensive, but is more flexible than USB-C.</em></figcaption>  </figure>",
