From May 5th, Amazon Prime subscribers will have to pay $8.99 (£8.99) a month or $89 (£89) a year for access to Music Unlimited, up from $7.99 (£7.99) and $79 (£79) respectively. The price of the single-device plan — which lets you listen to the full library but only from a single Echo or Fire TV device — is also increasing from $3.99 (£3.99) to $4.99 (£4.99) a month. If you’re not a Prime member, the price of Amazon Music Unlimited is unchanged at $9.99 (£9.99).</p><p id=\"nl1wLX\">As <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-music-unlimited-price-is-going-up-a-dollar-to-899-for-prime-members-074553977.html?src=rss\"><em>Engadget </em>notes</a>, the price change all but eliminates the discount that Amazon Prime subscribers get when paying for Amazon Music on top of their regular monthly subscription to Amazon. Rather than getting a $2 a month discount, they now get just $1 off compared to non-Prime subscribers. News of the price increase comes weeks after Amazon increased its Prime subscription prices for the first time in four years from $119 to $139 annually, or $12.99 to $14.99 monthly. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"6Uy2kb\"><q>Prices for non-Prime members are staying the same</q></aside></div><p id=\"ficQOD\">Amazon does include a paired down version of its music streaming service with a regular Prime subscription, but it features a limited catalog of just 2 million songs (compared to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GW3PHAUCZM8L7W9L\">90 million with Unlimited</a>). There’s also no support for lossless CD-quality, or hi-res music streams without paying for Unlimited.</p><p id=\"YeSSep\">Amazon Music is often reported to be the world’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22892939/music-streaming-services-market-share-q2-2021-spotify-apple-amazon-tencent-youtube\">third-largest music streaming service</a> behind Spotify and Apple Music. As of Q2 last year, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22892939/music-streaming-services-market-share-q2-2021-spotify-apple-amazon-tencent-youtube\">research agency Midia reported</a> that Apple Music (which typically costs $9.99 a month) had around 78.6 million subscribers, compared to Amazon Music (including both Prime Music and Music Unlimited) with just over 68.1 million. Spotify ($9.99 a month), meanwhile, had <a href=\"https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2022/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-2021/default.aspx\">180 million premium subscribers</a> at the end of last year.</p>",
