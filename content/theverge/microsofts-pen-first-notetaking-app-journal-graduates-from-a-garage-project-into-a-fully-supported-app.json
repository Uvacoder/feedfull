The app lets you write and draw like many other notetaking apps, but it also supports gestures like scratching out words to erase them and circling words or phrases to select them. You can use the app to mark up PDFs, which is a popular thing to do, according to Malone; a pie chart in her post says that 59 percent of all page types in Journal were PDFs.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"A screenshot from the Microsoft Journal app. On the left, there is a list of notes with a couple drawings.
