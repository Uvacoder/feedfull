You have to enable a flag at chrome://flags#enable-variable-refresh-rate to access the feature, which Google says can be used with “capable displays.”</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"gaouL7\"><q>This might signal an upgrade for future Chrome OS tablets</q></aside></div><p id=\"qfJ8ET\">VRR helps prevent screen-tearing by syncing the refresh rate of a display with the frames-per-second (FPS) of whatever’s on the screen. Google’s test of the feature could indicate a smoother gaming experience on Chrome OS, which would make sense considering <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/15/22979368/steam-chromeos-chromebook-valve-google-2022-alpha\">Google just announced Steam is “coming soon” to Chrome OS</a>. Rumors about the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22904183/gaming-chromebooks-rgb-nvidia-rtx-leaks\">release of three potential gaming-focused Chromebooks</a> have been floating around as well, a possibility that’s only been made stronger with a new Chrome OS flag that adds RGB keyboard support.</p><p id=\"yqizEG\">But on the other hand, VRR support could signal an upgraded refresh rate for future Chrome OS tablets. As my colleague Dan Seifert notes in his review of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22838058/hp-chromebook-x2-11-lenovo-chromebook-duet-5-tablet-review-comparison-head-to-head\">Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5 and the HP Chromebook X2 11</a>, Chrome OS is currently quite clunky when used in tablet form. Tablets running Chrome OS will need VRR if they want to compete with the likes of Samsung and Apple — the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22923565/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-plus-tablets-android-price-specs-features\">Samsung Galaxy Tab S8</a> lineup has a refresh rate of 120Hz, while the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor\">iPad Pro comes with ProMotion support</a> (which is basically another name for VRR) that makes scrolling animations smoother.</p>",
