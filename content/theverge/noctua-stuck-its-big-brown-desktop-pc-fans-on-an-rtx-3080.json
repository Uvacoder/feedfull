The two companies’ last collaboration was an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702067/asus-noctua-fan-cooler-nvidia-rtx-3070-graphics-card-leak-price\">RTX 3070</a>, but now they’ve announced a decidedly enthusiast tier card: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FMotherboards-Components%2FGraphics-Cards%2FASUS%2FRTX3080-O10G-NOCTUA%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F5%2F17%2F23078107%2Fnoctua-asus-rtx-3080-graphics-card-quiet\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an RTX 3080</a>.</p><p id=\"ARPGNd\">According to <a href=\"https://noctua.at/en/asus-geforce-rtx-3080-noctua-edition-graphics-card\">Noctua’s press release</a>, the card features two 120mm fans and a custom heatsink, making it “the quietest air-cooled graphics card in its class.” Apart from the fancy cooling, it’s a relatively standard Asus graphics card with two BIOS profiles, a backplate, and 10GB of GDDR6X RAM. There are 3080s with 12GB of memory, but that doesn’t seem to be an option with the Noctua heatsink.</p><p id=\"QvdpGh\">The card will go on sale “starting early June 2022,” though whether you’ll be able to buy one is another question entirely, with chip shortages and stock wonkiness still <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022\">plaguing the GPU market</a>. In a perfect world, you wouldn’t have to compete with crypto miners for the card — like most Nvidia cards nowadays it’s a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency\">Lite Hash Rate model</a> with reducing mining capabilities. Though, given that hackers <a href=\"https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-30-lite-hash-rate-lhr-has-been-fully-unlocked\">have found a way around that</a>, the bets may be off there.</p><p id=\"V6K2R1\">There is one way the card isn’t quite standard: it is <em>big</em>. For one, Noctua’s “custom-engineered unified heatsink” is thicker than Asus’ standard one, according to a webpage breaking down its performance versus regular cards. It’s also got literal desktop fans in it: Noctua’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NF-A12x25-PWM-Premium-Quality-Quiet/dp/B07C5VG64V?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NF-A12x25 PWM model</a>. This leads to it being around 3.25-inches thick, according to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FMotherboards-Components%2FGraphics-Cards%2FASUS%2FRTX3080-O10G-NOCTUA%2Ftechspec%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F5%2F17%2F23078107%2Fnoctua-asus-rtx-3080-graphics-card-quiet\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Asus’ spec sheet</a>, almost an inch thicker than <a href=\"https://rog.asus.com/us/graphics-cards/graphics-cards/rog-strix/rog-strix-rtx3080-o10g-gaming-model/spec\">the company’s triple-fan Strix 3080</a>. That means it’ll take up a whopping <em>four</em> slots in your PC — and still have a tiny bit of overhang into the next slot’s space.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TXuCrLWU-MIQs0Uj0rYvU3-QqR8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23519976/Screen_Shot_2022_05_17_at_11.32.19.png\">      <cite>Image: Asus</cite>      <figcaption><em>You have to be down with the thickness if you want this card.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"Tf1ssK\">For some people, that may not be worth it. One of my co-workers, for example, feels like there has to be a more interesting or better solution than just sticking some full-size fans on it and calling it a day. He probably wouldn’t be particularly impressed looking at the performance specs either; the Noctua 3080 has an “OC Mode” boost clock of 1815MHz and a “Gaming Mode” boost clock of 1785MHz. That’s pretty much the same as Asus’ standard 3080s, but the <a href=\"https://rog.asus.com/us/graphics-cards/graphics-cards/rog-strix/rog-strix-rtx3080-o10g-gaming-model/spec\">Strix model</a> puts out significantly higher numbers: 1935MHz in OC Mode and 1905MHz in Gaming Mode. </p><p id=\"64yyVk\">Noctua isn’t usually about redline performance, though; it’s about good performance while making as little noise as possible. Noctua says that “at typical auto-speed fan settings” its 3080 will be 4.5 dB(A) quieter than Asus’ TUF-series model, while running 3 degrees Celsius cooler on the GPU cores. When the cooler’s running all out, it says, Noctua’s will be 1 degree Celsius cooler and 8.6 dB(A) quieter. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hOLxdYV-92AAbCHWeT4XW1guUoY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23519620/noctua_gif_2.gif\">      <cite>Image: Asus</cite>      <figcaption><em>Noctua’s color scheme is an acquired taste, but pretty much anybody can appreciate the company’s cooling expertise.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"yDa9PZ\">For people who want performance but don’t want to hear it (hi, it’s me), it could be a good option — or at least that was the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LCxir54Cpc\">consensus with the 3070 version of this card</a>. We’ll likely have to wait until independent testers get their hands on it to see if Noctua’s cooler can stay quiet while trying to contain the 3080’s significant power. </p><p id=\"jYZJ4w\">As for pricing, Noctua’s press release says to “contact your local ASUS representative for further information on pricing,” and Asus’ website doesn’t have pricing info. Asus’ “entry-level” 3080s are going for <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fasus-geforce-rtx-3080-tuf-rtx3080-o10g-v2-gaming%2Fp%2FN82E16814126525%3FDescription%3Drtf%25203080%2520asus%26cm_re%3Drtf_3080%2520asus-_-14-126-525-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">around $850</a>, and the fancier models can <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fasus-geforce-rtx-3080-rtx3080-o10g-wht-v2%2Fp%2FN82E16814126533%3FDescription%3Drtf%25203080%2520asus%26cm_re%3Drtf_3080%2520asus-_-14-126-533-_-Product\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cost close to $1,100</a>. </p><p id=\"A3CXJj\">Based on the pricing of the 3070 edition, the Noctua edition will likely come with a price premium; on Newegg, an Asus Dual RTX 3070 V2 OC <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fasus-geforce-rtx-3070-dual-rtx3070-o8g-v2%2Fp%2FN82E16814126531%3FDescription%3DRTX%25203070%25208GB%2520asus%26cm_re%3DRTX_3070%25208GB%2520asus-_-14-126-531-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">goes for around $760</a>, where the Noctua OC Edition <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fasus-geforce-rtx-3070-rtx3070-o8g-noctua%2Fp%2FN82E16814126545\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">goes for $854</a>. Asus’ Strix model, which has higher boost clocks than both models, <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fasus-geforce-rtx-3070-rog-strix-rtx3070-o8g-v2-gaming%2Fp%2FN82E16814126518%3FDescription%3DRTX%25203070%25208GB%2520asus%26cm_re%3DRTX_3070%25208GB%2520asus-_-14-126-518-_-Product\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">goes for $806</a>. Do take these comparisons with a grain of salt; they’re third-party store prices (though the same third-party store), and we’re not quite out of the bizarre-o GPU pricing woods <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23031309/nvidia-amd-gpu-price-in-stock-retail-ebay\">quite yet</a>. </p><p id=\"buDtWi\">There’s also the question of whether you should even be buying a high-end 30-series card at this point. There are rumors that Nvidia’s going to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/16/23076656/nvidia-rtx-4090-rumor-release-july-2022\">release the 4090 in July</a>, kicking off its next generation of cards. Given how long it’s been since the 3080 was launched, it could be <em>quite </em>a while before we see a Noctua-equipped 4090.</p><p id=\"E2JihI\"></p>",
