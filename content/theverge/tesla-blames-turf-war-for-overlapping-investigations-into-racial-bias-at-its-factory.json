The company accused DFEH of rushing its lawsuit in an effort to get ahead of the EEOC investigation, calling it a “bare bones investigation,” according to <em>Reuters</em>. </p><p id=\"6VGm94\">Tesla is requesting the court pause the DFEH lawsuit until it is able to resolve the EEOC investigation. The company also accused DFEH of violating a state law that requires it to meet certain thresholds before suing an employer. </p><p id=\"w88fFT\">This isn’t the first time that DFEH and EEOC have butted heads over employee harassment claims. The state agency recently lost a bid to block EEOC’s $18 million settlement with Activision Blizzard in a gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment claim. Last summer, DFEH filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, alleging the company fostered a culture of “constant sexual harassment.”</p><p id=\"ix34AG\">Tesla has faced <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/business/tesla-factory-racism.html\">numerous allegations</a> of racial discrimination and harassment at its Fremont plant. Last October, a jury awarded a Black former Tesla employee $137 million in damages after he accused the company of ignoring racial abuse and discrimination. (A judge later <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23025226/tesla-racism-lawsuit-award-reduce-owen-diaz\">reduced that award to $15 million</a>.) </p><p id=\"7Kzyg9\">The company also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611725/tesla-paid-1-million-black-former-employee-racist-slur\">paid $1 million</a> to another Black former employee who said he was called the n-word by a supervisor. Tesla currently <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/14/tesla-class-action-lawsuit-alleges-racism-unsafe-factory-conditions.html\">faces a class-action lawsuit</a> alleging racism at its flagship factory.</p>",
