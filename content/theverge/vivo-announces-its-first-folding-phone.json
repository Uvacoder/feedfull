The X Fold takes a similar approach to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series and its competitors, with a large 8.03-inch folding screen on the inside for tablet-style use and a more conventional phone-sized screen — in this case, 6.53 inches — on the outside. </p><p id=\"hxdCJP\">Like Samsung, Vivo’s folding display uses a layer of Ultra Thin Glass (UTG) <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning\">produced by Schott</a>, which should help with durability. <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_x_fold_arrives_with_snapdragon_8_gen_1_flagship_cameras-news-53909.php\"><em>GSMArena</em> reports</a> that its hinge allows the phone to fold flat or to be propped open at angles between 60 and 120 degrees. According <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/vivo-x-fold-3151346/\">to <em>Android Authority</em></a>, Vivo advertises that the phone’s screen should survive 300,000 folds, which appears to be a big increase over the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum\">200,000 folds Samsung claimed</a> for its most recent generation of foldables.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6PKHP6Fndt-IzXS_BFSyWJhknA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23381743/gsmarena_004.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Vivo</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Vivo X Fold has four rear cameras.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"GXeNwO\">Beyond its folding capabilities, the Vivo X Fold sports recognizably flagship specs. It’s powered by Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor and has a 4,600mAh battery that can be charged at 50W wirelessly or at 66W using a cable. Both its screens support up to a 120Hz refresh rate and have ultrasonic fingerprint scanners built into them.</p><p id=\"0L5NZu\">There are four cameras on its rear: a 50-megapixel main camera, a 48-megapixel ultrawide, a 12-megapixel 2x telephoto, and an 8-megapixel 5x periscope, according to <em>Android Authority</em>. Both inner and outer screens come with hole-punch selfie cameras with a resolution of 16-megapixels. </p><p id=\"AC5w7h\">Vivo is part of the BBK supply chain empire, sharing ownership with Oppo, OnePlus, and Realme. Oppo released its first folding phone last year, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22837149/oppo-find-n-hands-on-announcement-specs-price\">Find N</a>, which was an impressive device with slightly smaller screens than the Vivo X Fold. Both of these devices are exclusive to China for now.</p><p id=\"XAuHGA\">The Vivo X Fold’s price will start at ¥8,999 (around $1,413) for its 12GB RAM, 256GB storage model. There’s also a 512GB storage variant that’ll retail for ¥9,999 (around $1,570).</p>",
