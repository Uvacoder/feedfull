You’ve had your <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs\">good but boring</a> $449 Pixel 5A for nearly nine months, been patiently <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/26/23042395/android-13-public-beta-media-file-permissions-error-reporting-audio-routing\">testing the Android 13 beta</a> for two weeks, and lamenting about how you can’t connect the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 to it using the Android Wear OS app because <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22620869/galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-3-samsung-wearable-google-smartwatch-tizen-one-ui\">that’s how things are</a>. Enter Google I/O, the conference you hope will fix all of that, maybe spill the beans on a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/24/23039835/google-pixel-watch-leak-photos-prototype-left-at-restaurant\">rumored new watch</a> from Google, and, most importantly, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23063497/google-support-pixel-watch-6a-io-2022\">finish whatever new thing it starts</a>. And maybe you wouldn’t mind tossing that Pixel 5A for a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/12/23021861/google-pixel-6a-fcc-may-release-io\">fresh Pixel 6A announcement rumored to happen</a>.</p><p id=\"mN2DVD\">Want to know if these rumored devices actually get announced? You’re in the right place — scroll down for all the latest news, announcements, and Android 13 changes coming straight out of Google I/O, the company’s yearly developer conference going on from May 11th through May 12th.</p>",
