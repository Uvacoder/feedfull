The folks at <a href=\"https://whatsondisneyplus.com/disney-suffering-from-multiple-missing-episodes/\">What’s on Disney Plus</a> collected a list of some of the shows with known missing episodes early Tuesday, and it’s a long one, including favorites like <em>Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place, Once Upon a Time,</em> and many others.</p><p id=\"ZM4FH3\">Disney commented to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/04/twitter-elon-musk-tesla-jack-dorsey-apollo-1235005233/\"><em>Deadline</em></a> that the “purge” is an accidental glitch it’s working to fix, and we’ve noticed that episodes have been restored for some series, like season one of <em>Agent Carter</em>. Meanwhile, others like <em>DuckTales</em>, or <em>Rocket &amp; Groot,</em> are still incomplete.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4dI17Hk0McANsPvgmq1a9_o21eo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23402106/disney_plus_missingeps.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Richard Lawler via DisneyPlus.com</cite>  </figure><p id=\"0NPCah\">An occasional hiccup on a streaming platform is to be expected, and as long as it doesn’t keep fans from their next episode of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22999812/moon-knight-review%5C\"><em>Moon Knight</em></a> or the premiere of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23004696/obi-wan-kenobi-disney-plus-premiere-two-days-later-two-episodes\"><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></a>, it will likely be quickly forgotten. </p><p id=\"vuqyaS\">The odd thing is that Disney Plus now has a track record of these oddities when you include recent instances where edited versions were swapped in for some of the Marvel Netflix shows before they were fixed. Or the time a couple of weeks ago when Disney Plus US — which maintains some family-friendly restrictions on the content it includes even though it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22955274/netflix-marvel-shows-disney-plus-release-date\">has new parental controls</a> — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/05/disney-removes-adult-focused-films-after-mistakingly-adding-them-to-its-u-s-service/\">streamed <em>Hot Shots </em>and <em>Hot Shots Part Deux</em> for a few days before they were removed</a>.</p><aside id=\"ufhGam\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How to set your content rating in Disney Plus \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22980817/disney-plus-content-rating-parental-services-kids-how-to\"}]}'></div></aside>",
