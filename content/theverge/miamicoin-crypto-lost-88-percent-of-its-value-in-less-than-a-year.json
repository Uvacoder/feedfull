The winning bidder receives 70 percent of their investment in MiamiCoin, while the city receives the other 30 percent in STX tokens. </p><div id=\"4Zwops\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’m so excited to announce that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CityofMiami?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CityofMiami</a> has received its first-ever disbursement from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mineCityCoins?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mineCityCoins</a> totaling $5.25M. <br><br>This is a historic moment for our city to collaborate with an innovative project that creates resources for our city through innovation not taxation.</p>— Mayor Francis Suarez (@FrancisSuarez) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1489009285447262211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 2, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"MiamiCoin value — May 16th, 2022\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/noZjIvgCfHbHo6l4wuuTqP-csq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23485625/miamicoin_okcoin.jpg\">      <cite>Image: OkCoin exchange</cite>      <figcaption>MiamiCoin value — May 16th, 2022</figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"O9vc9y\">At first, things seemed good — Suarez <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1489009285447262211\">said</a> the city received a $5.25 million payout from the project on February 2nd. However, 17 days later, the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article258545643.html\"><em>Miami Herald</em></a> quoted the mayor saying “I don’t know whether it’s going to work,” as the coin’s value dropped to around four-tenths of a cent, and it sits at $0.0044 today, down more than 88 percent as reported by OkCoin, the only exchange that supports trading for the coin. Separately, <em>Quartz </em>obtained an email from CityCoins to the mayor’s office citing worries that his statements could trip “regulatory wires” — if the SEC investigated and decided the coin is unregistered security instead of currency, both CitcyCoin and the city could have to give investors their money back. </p><p id=\"h1z84o\"><em>Quartz </em>reports that Patrick Stanley, listed as a supporter on the CityCoins website, has apparently been a frequent contact for city officials, and says the currency could be used for local business transactions or universal basic income. None of those applications have become real, yet Stanley tweeted a picture just today of people apparently learning to develop projects that might use the crypto somehow. <em>Quartz </em>also mentioned one open city proposal, which would have the coin serve as a reward for people who call to report rideshare scooters left laying around.</p><p id=\"zzVroX\">Of course, Miami isn’t alone in its CityCoin push. In November, as Suarez promised to take a paycheck in Bitcoin, then-new New York City mayor Eric Adams <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893275/nyc-mayor-adams-convert-paycheck-cryptocurrency-coinbase-bitcoin-ethereum\">said he’d take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin to top the stunt</a>, and welcomed CityCoins to the area. Bitcoin reached its peak value of $69,000 in about that same week and is currently trading for about $30,000. The NYCCoin project that launched on January 24th, 2022, has shed some 98.58 percent from its value and is trading for $0.0014. </p><aside id=\"ynwEvw\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"NYC Mayor takes pay cut as cryptocurrency market plunges \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/22/22896232/nyc-mayor-bitcoin-crypto-market-eric-adams\"}]}'></div></aside>",
