Cerebral will still offer drugs that treat opioid-use disorder, like Suboxone.</p><p id=\"UdWqgT\">Robertson said in the email that the company only started prescribing controlled substances to customers in 2020 because people weren’t able to get in-person care. It’s stopping that program, he said, because of “the ability for patients to return to an in-person or hybrid care model for this treatment.”</p><p id=\"kQizNy\">But many pharmacies <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/9/23063356/cerebral-telehealth-prescriptions-investigation-adhd-adderall-doj-dea\">had already</a> stopped filling prescriptions from Cerebral for Adderall and other controlled substances. Before then, nurse practitioners working for the company had <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-make-it-easier-to-get-adhd-drugs-that-made-some-workers-anxious-11648267205?mod=article_inline\">told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> that they worried about pressures to give customers the drugs after only a short call. </p><p id=\"yaQUNI\">Cerebral <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/9/23063356/cerebral-telehealth-prescriptions-investigation-adhd-adderall-doj-dea\">said</a> in a statement to <em>Insider</em> that it is fully cooperating with all federal investigations and that it has not been accused of violating any laws. </p><p id=\"lxvNKf\"></p>",
