That's why we're proud to announce that our next <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tombraider?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tombraider</a> game is being built on Unreal Engine 5! <a href=\"https://t.co/UFMiWzJAZc\">pic.twitter.com/UFMiWzJAZc</a></p>— Tomb Raider (@tombraider) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tombraider/status/1511368712279904258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 5, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"1CmsmV\"><em>Tomb Raider</em> launched on the original PlayStation in 1996 and has spawned numerous sequels, a reboot, and three movies (of which, the two Angelina Jolie movies, I maintain, are good). It’s been four years since the last <em>Tomb Raider</em> game, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17845776/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review-xbox-ps4-pc\"><em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em></a>, launched to tepid reviews, and it is not yet known if this new game will continue where <em>Shadow</em> left off.</p><p id=\"J5IHlY\">Dallas Dickinson, franchise director at Crystal Dynamics, used the announcement to tout the advantages of creating a game with Unreal Engine 5, saying, “this new engine translates into next-level storytelling and gameplay experiences.” </p><p id=\"VQzOzp\">Crystal Dynamics wasn’t the only studio gushing about Unreal Engine 5. Developers from <em>Gears of War</em> maker The Coalition and<em> The Witcher</em> studio CD Projekt Red talked about how UE5 makes their development processes easier. </p><p id=\"FxUhmN\">The Unreal Engine 5 presentation itself did have more than just slick, hyper-realistic trailers. At one point during a demo of<em> Lyra</em>, the new multiplayer shooter launched with Unreal Engine 5, the presenter got adorably excited about the game’s stair generation capabilities.</p><div id=\"jBHg5j\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ZLibi6s_ew?rel=0&amp;start=755\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"cPFYmo\"><em>Tomb Raider</em> turned 25 last year and celebrated by announcing that both <em>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light </em>and <em>Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris</em> would make their debut on the Nintendo Switch later this year.</p>",
