The new game will be the latest in an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991170/netflix-mobile-games-first-fps-subscription\">ever-growing series of mobile titles</a> available to play for free with a Netflix subscription.</p><p id=\"JsCKEe\">There’s already a version of<em> Exploding Kittens </em>available on the App Store and Google Play, but with Netflix’s version, there will be two exclusive cards at launch. Down the line, there will be new cards and game mechanics “themed around the animated series.” The version of <em>Exploding Kittens</em> that’s currently available (which is a paid game) will remain on the app stores after the new version launches, Netflix spokesperson Tawni Argent tells <em>The Verge. </em>Unfortunately, any progress, expansion packs, or saves you might have from the current mobile versions won’t transfer to Netflix’s game, as they are two separate titles.</p><p id=\"lH6Zct\">The upcoming TV show promises to be as wacky as you might expect. “In the animated series, titled <em>Exploding Kittens</em>, the eternal conflict between Heaven and Hell reaches epic proportions when both God and the Devil are sent to Earth — in the bodies of chunky house cats,” according to a synopsis from a press release.</p><div id=\"pcgtef\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">meet the cast of the new Netflix animated comedy series, EXPLODING KITTENS - produced by comedy legends Mike Judge and Greg Daniels <a href=\"https://t.co/UA8nWNAguA\">pic.twitter.com/UA8nWNAguA</a></p>— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1516084145528709133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"0su0uk\">Executive producers for the show include Mike Judge and Greg Daniels, known for their work on <em>King of the Hill</em>, and the game’s creators, Elan Lee and Matthew Inman.
