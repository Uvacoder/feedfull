In April, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/20/23034175/apple-store-workers-atlanta-union-retail-amazon-google\">it became the first Apple retail location</a> to file for a union election in the US. Workers at the Grand Central Terminal store in New York have also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/16/23028356/apple-store-workers-grand-central-terminal-new-york-union-signatures\">launched a union drive</a>, as have workers at the Towson Town Center store in Maryland. </p><p id=\"qBcTU9\">Apple pushed to hold the vote in July, according to a source familiar with the situation. The CWA opposed the later election date, as the move could have given Apple more time to dissuade workers from unionizing. While Apple hasn’t officially said it is against workers organizing, the company is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23041632/apple-hires-anti-union-lawyers-littler-mendelson-union-fight-cwa\">working with anti-union lawyers from Littler Mendelson</a>, the same firm used by companies like Starbucks and McDonald’s.</p><p id=\"0zI0IY\">Last month, organizers <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/29/23048296/apple-retail-store-union-atlanta-cumberland-mall-open-letter\">posted a letter</a> explaining their vision for what working at the company should be like, including specific changes they wanted Apple to make. They explained that they’re looking for a variety of improvements, such as better compensation (including cost of living adjustments to pay), better career development options for retail workers, and enforcement of health and safety protocols, especially around COVID.
