YouTube chief product officer Neal Mohan promised <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/10/22926293/youtube-tv-new-features-picture-in-picture-ios-surround-sound-landscape-mode\">on <em>The Vergecast</em></a> that the feature was on the way, and now it’s finally here. </p><div id=\"CpmtFE\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Vergecast gets results ;) <a href=\"https://t.co/z57srOSCLQ\">https://t.co/z57srOSCLQ</a></p>— nilay patel (@reckless) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1509263740482600962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"gDE67Z\">With picture-in-picture, you’ll be able to keep watching YouTube TV when you navigate away from the YouTube TV app. The feature could come in handy if, for example, you’re watching a sports game but want to scroll through Twitter to see reactions to what just happened on the field. It’s a feature that’s been available on Android <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16684872/youtube-tv-picture-in-picture-android-oreo-update-play-store-google\">for years</a>, so it’s good to see that Google has finally brought it over to Apple’s iOS devices.</p><div id=\"nkjvrg\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP9442356956&amp;light=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div><p id=\"NSnCHt\">That said, we’re still waiting for Google to launch picture-in-picture for all users of the standard YouTube app on iOS, no YouTube Premium subscription required. That feature is in testing if you <em>do</em> have a Premium subscription, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/new\">YouTube’s Labs page currently says</a> you can try it out until April 8th.</p><p id=\"pC0jgl\">In a statement <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/01/youtube-still-testing-picture-in-picture-on-ios/\">given to <em>MacRumors</em> in February</a>, Google said that it’s “still planning to launch PiP for all users without a YouTube Premium subscription in the US” but that “We have no other updates to share at this time.” In a statement to <em>The Verge</em> on Wednesday, Google spokesperson Allison Toh said that the company is “still testing picture-in-picture on iOS with Premium members and hope to make it available to all iOS users (Premium and non-Premium) in the US in the coming months.”</p><aside id=\"MPivce\"><div data-anthem-component=\"actionbox\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"title\":\"The Vergecast\",\"description\":\"The podcast you need to make sense of the week in tech news\",\"label\":\"Subscribe\",\"url\":\"https://pod.link/430333725\"}'></div></aside><p id=\"l2JjrS\"><em><strong>Update March 30th, 6:05PM ET</strong></em><em>: Added comment from Google.</em></p>",
