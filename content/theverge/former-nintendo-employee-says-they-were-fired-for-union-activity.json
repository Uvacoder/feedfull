In a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/nintendo-nlrb-complaint-3bb227c7-40c3-40c5-9578-5190e595a00e.html\">report from<em> Axios</em></a>, a former employee alleges that Nintendo and its staffing and recruiting partner Aston Carter fired them after engaging in protected organizing activities. </p><p id=\"fgnLoe\">In <a href=\"https://www.nlrb.gov/case/19-CA-294207\">a filing with the National Labor Relations Board</a>, a summary of the charges against Nintendo include:</p><ul><li id=\"BoetI5\">Engaging in surveillance or creating the impression of surveillance of employees’ union activities</li><li id=\"wVHHHX\">Discharging an employee for engaging in protected activities such as discussing wages and other terms and conditions of employment</li><li id=\"4k255Z\">Discharging an employee because they joined or supported labor organization</li></ul><p id=\"OrbqCN\">Nintendo isn’t the only video game company contending with the NLRB.

Activision Blizzard has been accused multiple times of union-busting after sending emails asking employees to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828146/activision-blizzard-exec-brain-bulatao-anti-unionization-letter\">“consider the consequences”</a> of signing union cards and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23015299/activision-blizzard-raven-software-unionizing-employees-qa-raises\">giving raises to every QA employee except those at Raven</a> who are working toward unionization. </p><p id=\"9RVhwn\">Outside of gaming, companies are starting to provide raises to employees in hopes of stemming <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/22993509/starbucks-successful-union-drive\">the growing tide of unionization</a>.
