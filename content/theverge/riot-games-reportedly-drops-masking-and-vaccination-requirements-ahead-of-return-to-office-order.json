Riot is also no longer requiring regular COVID-19 testing for employees who have not shown proof of vaccination. </p><p id=\"br4MlO\">The <em>Vice</em> report spoke to several current and former Riot employees who expressed anger that the new policy would danger employees’ health. “It’s a foolish and pointless policy being done at a poor time and being handled without real guarantee of our safety,” one anonymous employee said to <em>Vice</em>. </p><p id=\"TsmkcD\">However, despite these concerns, Riot is acting in accordance with state and federal COVID-19 guidelines. California recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/23/world/covid-19-tests-cases-vaccine/los-angeles-county-removes-mask-mandate-for-indoor-public-places\">dropped its indoor masking mandate</a> (requiring proof of vaccination or a negative covid test), and other states are following suit. </p><p id=\"JWNxHR\">Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/1/23007115/activision-blizzard-workers-walkout-vaccine-mandate-a-better-abk\">Activision Blizzard came under fire</a> after a leaked email to employees from chief operating officer Brian Bulatao revealed that it, too, would be returning to the office without vaccination requirements. After a storm of backlash on social media, <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23010343/activision-blizzard-vaccine-mandate-demands-abetterabk\">including a virtual walkout</a>, Activision Blizzard amended its decision, allowing individual studios to make their own vaccination and masking determinations. </p><p id=\"exVBhL\"></p>",
