Wade</em></a> in the United States, indie tabletop RPG developers are stepping up. Today, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RollForRomance\"><em>Roll for Romance</em></a>, a <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> podcast, in collaboration with over 200 TTRPG creators, launched <a href=\"https://itch.io/b/1375/ttrpgs-for-reproductive-rights\">TTRPGs for Reproductive Rights</a> on <a href=\"http://itch.io\">itch.io</a>. </p><div id=\"4ca5KU\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The TTRPGs for Reproductive Rights bundle is live! 291 creations from over 200 amazing designers worth almost $1400. Grab this incredible collection for just $5!<br><br>All proceeds go to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AbortionFunds?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AbortionFunds</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PPFA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PPFA</a>!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ttrpg?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ttrpg</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReproductiveRights?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ReproductiveRights</a></p>— Roll for Romance   Thirsty DnD Podcast (@RollForRomance) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RollForRomance/status/1525096168077901825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"xxnDxf\">“Reproductive rights are fundamental and non-negotiable human rights that we must fight to protect,” the description of the bundle reads. </p><p id=\"NtyX03\">The TTRPGs for Reproductive Rights bundle features over 275 games valued at over $1,000 for only $5. All proceeds from sales benefit the National Network for Abortion Funds and Planned Parenthood. One of the games featured in the bundle is <a href=\"https://joncole.itch.io/abortionists-fastaval-2019\">The Abortionists</a>, a LARP (or live-action role-playing game) that seems to touch on the story of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Collective\">Jane Collective</a>, a group of women in Illinois who offered underground abortion services in 1972 before <em>Roe v. Wade</em> legalized abortion at the federal level.</p><p id=\"hShIda\">TTRPGs for Reproductive Rights isn’t alone in its support of abortion rights. After news about the leaked Supreme Court opinion broke, <a href=\"https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/51315\">Bungie became the first video game company to speak out</a>, condemning the news and offering support for its employees.</p><p id=\"x8EJk9\">“Bungie is committed to safeguarding the freedom and privacy of its employees and providing support to all employees affected by this decision,” read Bungie’s statement. <em>Psychonauts 2</em> developer Double Fine <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DoubleFine/status/1522687507166494720?s=20&amp;t=DjUqU33gvso48tQXqfhc3g\">also spoke out, saying</a>, “We firmly believe that a decision to overturn <em>Roe vs. Wade</em> would deny people their human rights, and directly impact the lives, freedoms, and choices of everyone in this country.”</p><p id=\"hllmtN\"><a href=\"http://Itch.io\">Itch.io</a> has become the go-to site for charitable gaming endeavors. Back in March, the platform hosted a <a href=\"https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine\">bundle for Ukrainian relief</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22967069/itch-io-ukraine-bundle-support-charity\">earning over $1 million in its first day</a>. In 2020, the platform also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287909/itch-io-bundle-for-racial-justice-equality-five-million-dollar-goal-hit\">raised over $8 million</a> in its <a href=\"https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality\">Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</a>, supporting the <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/\">NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> and <a href=\"https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bail_funds_george_floyd\">Community Bail Fund</a>. TTRPGs for Reproductive Rights seems on track to enjoy similar success. Originally, the goal for the bundle was $2,500, but after being live for a little more than four hours, it’s more than doubled that goal. The TTRPGs for Reproductive Rights bundle ends on June 13th.</p>",
