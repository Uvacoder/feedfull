With its small form-factor and ultrawide 32:9 aspect ratio it looks as though Asus has ripped the secondary display off <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21431381/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review\">one of its Duo laptops</a> and turned it into an external monitor. </p><p id=\"1zOyQT\">The PA147CDV was technically <a href=\"https://edgeup.asus.com/2021/proart-display-pa147cdv-intro/\">announced last September</a>, but Asus is currently showing it off at the <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/asus-debuts-new-proart-creator-display-lineup-at-nab-2022-301531182.html\">NAB 2022 show in Las Vegas</a> and is announcing plans to release the monitor in Q2 2022 in North America at a price that’s yet to be announced.</p><p id=\"4JUk8a\">With its support for Microsoft’s Pen Protocol 2.0, and a built in dial that’s designed to emulate the functionality of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/26/13417028/microsoft-surface-dial-announced-surface-event\">Microsoft’s Surface Dial</a>, Asus is pitching the PA147CDV as an accessory for creatives looking for a little extra screen real-estate without investing in a bulky second monitor or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18150155/wacom-cintiq-16-pen-display\">touchscreen tablet</a>. Hopefully it’ll be priced less than competing displays with larger screen sizes. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qkaU7njiwViOREqrrRCswI7V3Qg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23414398/PA147_L4.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Asus</cite>      <figcaption><em>The display’s dial can emulate a Microsoft Surface Dial. </em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"0VnyTt\">The PA147CDV has a 14-inch 1920 x 550 IPS touchscreen, and is equipped with one HDMI port and two USB-C ports. Its stand allows it to be oriented horizontally or vertically. </p><p id=\"H6fs7i\">As well as the PA147CDV, Asus is also showing off a pair of additional monitors releasing later this year. The ProArt Display OLED PA32DC 31.5-inch 3840 x 2160 monitor, which was <a href=\"https://edgeup.asus.com/2021/proart-display-pa32dc-intro/\">revealed last September</a>, is planned for release in North America in Q3. It’ll be joined by the ProArt Display PA348CGV, an ultrawide 1440p monitor with a 120Hz refresh rate that was announced <a href=\"https://edgeup.asus.com/2022/proart-display-pa348cgv/\">back at CES 2022</a>. We’ll update this piece if and when Asus gets back to us about pricing. </p>",
