You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. </p><p id=\"pDKHVT\">Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons.</p><p id=\"2UeWxe\">Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products, which is why we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. Also, while newer models like the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite are currently only available for full price, keep in mind that Amazon also offers 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are available at a discount.</p><aside id=\"U51BKy\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best iPad deals right now \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple\"},{\"title\":\"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"r36wrm\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10741941\"></div></div><h2 id=\"jqPttv\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review\">Kindle (2019)</a> deals</h2><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"mXAcFi\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:10363966\"></div></div></div><p id=\"Hfprjz\">The 10th-gen Kindle is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $89.99. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, the latest model features a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. </p><p id=\"SvkJGJ\">The 10th-gen Kindle normally starts at $89.99 with ads, however, it’s currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Now-with-Built-in-Front-Light/dp/B07978J597/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1275357/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals030422&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-kindle-8gb-e-reader-black%2F-%2FA-79804909\">Target</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgKQB8nlhY1\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for $54.99. If you want the model without ads, it’s available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon for $69.99</a>, the standard retail price. Note, however, that if you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. If you’re looking to pick up more than one e-reader, Best Buy and Amazon are both offering $20 off a pair, the latter with promo code <strong>2PACK</strong>.</p><div id=\"5gB9S3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9552432\"></div></div><h2 id=\"ze80m8\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle Kids (2019)</a> deals</h2><p id=\"JypT34\">The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also released the Kindle Kids, which comes with a handful of accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109.99 ($20 more than the base Kindle at standard MSRP). </p><p id=\"6LlYfl\">The Kindle Kids Edition consists of four items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like <em>Percy Jackson</em> and <em>The Hobbit </em>at no additional cost.</p><p id=\"IHO6IB\">On the deals front, we recently saw the Kindle Kids drop to $59.99, its lowest price to date. Right now, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> are nearly matching that price, offering the kid-friendly e-reader up for $64.99. Both retailers are also providing a $20 discount when you purchase two, though, Amazon requires you to enter promo code <strong>2PACK </strong>at checkout to take advantage of the deal.</p><div id=\"3DEvBp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9552664\"></div></div><aside id=\"0EetaF\"><div data-anthem-component=\"actionbox\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"title\":\"Verge Deals on Twitter\",\"description\":\"Join our over 46,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals\",\"label\":\"Follow us!\",\"url\":\"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud\"}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"t6m9om\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle Paperwhite (2021)</a> deals</h2><p id=\"deHMlR\">Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">11th-gen model</a>, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger, 6.8-inch display. Given just how recently the new e-reader launched, however, we haven’t seen a ton of discounts yet. Thankfully, you can still pick up the last-gen model, which is frequently available for far less than the standard retail price.</p><p id=\"FkwzBt\">The 2021 Kindle Paperwhite comes in three main configurations: an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">8GB model with ads for $139.99</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38WQSH/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">8GB model without ads for $159.99</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">32GB, ad-free Signature Edition for $189.99</a>. The latter is identical to the standard Paperwhite, except it also features Qi wireless charging and a sensor that will automatically adjust the backlight when needed. Amazon has also rolled out a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition for $159.99</a>, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.</p><p id=\"3BWyZz\">While we saw the ad-supported Kindle Paperwhite recently drop to $109.99 around Valentine’s Day, it’s currently only available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported/dp/B09NWHZM1M/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgD07G1pJBS\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230703/2092?subId1=VergeBestKindleDeals122921&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fall-new-amazon-kindle-paperwhite-6-8-34-8gb-tablet-black%2F-%2FA-84609459\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a> starting at $139.99, its full retail price. If you buy the e-reader at Amazon, however, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost.</p><p id=\"f9ESnw\">Amazon also offers the 2021 Paperwhite as part of a bundle that includes a power adapter and either a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Essentials-Bundle-including/dp/B09FC51SFK/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fabric cover for $189.97</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FC2CDGF/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">leather cover for $179.97</a>, both of which are $20 off. The 32GB, ad-free Signature Edition is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FNY4RRP/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on sale at Amazon</a> for $249.97 ($20 off) as part of a discounted bundle, too, which also includes a “cork” cover and a wireless charging dock. </p><p id=\"P0nYFW\">Unfortunately, if you’re looking for the Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition, it’s only <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available at Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgKNNnx7ba4\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> right now for $159.99, its standard retail price, or as a two-pack for around $300. Again, you’ll need to use promo code <strong>2PACK </strong>at Amazon to apply the $20 discount on a pair.</p><div id=\"XEYFbp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10765216\"></div></div><div id=\"S8bhtR\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10913659\"></div></div><div id=\"KgIKKY\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10765369\"></div></div><h2 id=\"iorwh0\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle Paperwhite (2018)</a> deals</h2><p id=\"UaH6Zy\">While there currently are no price breaks on the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite — save for the discounts currently available on the various bundles — retailers like Amazon and Best Buy often lower the price of the last-gen model to $89.99 during major shopping holidays and bigger sales events. </p><p id=\"BgDfr5\">Right now, however, the 2018 e-reader is only available at Amazon in the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage/dp/B07CXG6C9W?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">8GB, ad-supported configuration for $109.99</a> ($20 off), as well as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage/dp/B07745PV5G?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">32GB configuration for $129.99</a> ($30 off). Additionally, Amazon is discounting the last-gen Kindle Paperwhite as part of a bundle in select color configurations. These packages include either the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LMWSKB/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">8GB e-reader with ads for $179.97</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084LMJK4R/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">32GB reader with ads for $209.97</a>, along with a fabric case and power adapter.</p><div id=\"Pezwn6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9552401\"></div></div><div id=\"uSbTUU\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10953222\"></div></div><h2 id=\"X5jbTU\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle Oasis (third-gen)</a> deals</h2><p id=\"IByP4u\">The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.</p><p id=\"1AvXZM\">The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. However, unlike previous models, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.</p><p id=\"SgMJ0g\">In the past, we’ve seen the 8GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $174.99, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $249.99 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">8GB, ad-supported Oasis is $249.99</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one without ads is $269.99</a>. If you need more storage, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">32GB version is $279.99 with ads</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$299.99 without</a>. Best Buy is also selling the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cguJ0ufRzMZ\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ad-supported base model for $249.99</a> or the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cguJ3cwlPlx\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">32GB variant for $279.99</a>, and offering a $20 discount when you purchase two. Amazon is currently running the same promotion, offering $20 off a pair with promo code <strong>2PACK</strong>.</p><p id=\"XuGlPY\">If you’re looking for a deal, the Kindle Oasis Essentials Bundle is currently on sale in select configurations at Amazon for $30 off its normal list price. Right now, you can get either the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RSVGLKV/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $279.97</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">32GB variant for $309.97</a>, both of which come with a power adapter and either a fabric or leather cover.</p><div id=\"hPPu8s\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9552599\"></div></div><div id=\"bGvy8i\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10913792\"></div></div><aside id=\"4mZNi9\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
