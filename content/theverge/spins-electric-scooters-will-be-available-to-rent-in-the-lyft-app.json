Lyft, which owns Citi Bike in New York City, continues to operate its own fleet of e-scooters despite many financial headwinds. </p><p id=\"sZqxN4\">Lyft’s partnership with Spin will kick off in Nashville, followed by 13 additional markets throughout April, including Phoenix, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City, Providence, Raleigh / Durham, Charlotte, Fort Collins, Ann Arbor, Kansas City, and Memphis. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"Yqye5z\"><q>Lyft’s partnership with Spin will kick off in Nashville</q></aside></div><p id=\"faT7DQ\">Riders will see Spin scooters as an option when they search their destination in the Lyft app. A Spin scooter can be unlocked via the Lyft app by scanning its QR code or entering the scooter ID number — similar to how Citi Bike customers can unlock a bike through the Lyft app. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-8zPuIeIVRQSHDqCggw-ul6VtFo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23340499/Lyft_Screen.jpg\">      <cite>Sunshine Shannon Photography</cite>  </figure><p id=\"nZ82XA\">The race among major tech companies to become the “Amazon of transportation” has slowed down since the COVID-19 pandemic upended daily life. But Lyft still sees value in integrating various services into its app, including Google Maps, CityMapper, Moovit, Transit app, Bytemark, and Velocia. </p><p id=\"fr1T0T\">Of course, Lyft isn’t the first to integrate another company’s scooters into its app. Lime’s scooters have been available to rent in Uber’s app since 2018 after the ride-hail company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/9/17548848/uber-investment-lime-scooter-alphabet\">contributed to a $335 million fundraising round for Lime</a>. Uber later sold its Jump e-bikes to Lime amid a broader move by the company to consolidate its holdings around car trips and delivery. </p>",
