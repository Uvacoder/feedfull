Though the story will presumably return to the Upside Down and catch up with Jim Hopper in Russia, <em>Stranger Things</em>’ first season four trailer makes clear that a significant part of its next chapter will unfold in California, where Joyce and the rest of the Byers family have moved.</p><p id=\"OkfuzH\">Vol. 1 of <em>Stranger Things </em>season 4 premieres on May 27th, 2022, and Vol. 2 drops on Netflix on July 1st, 2022.</p>",
