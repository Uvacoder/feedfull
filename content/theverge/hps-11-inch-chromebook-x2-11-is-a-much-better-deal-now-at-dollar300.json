Take <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg3RxswUIuB\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HP’s Chromebook x2 11 tablet, for example. It’s currently selling for $299.99 at Best Buy</a>, a price cut that’s mighty enough to outweigh its flaws. This one-day deal on the 11-inch tablet with Chrome OS makes for a much more compelling argument compared to its $599.99 regular price. When our own Dan Seifert <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22838058/hp-chromebook-x2-11-lenovo-chromebook-duet-5-tablet-review-comparison-head-to-head\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reviewed the Chromebook x2 in December 2021</a>, he scored it a 5.5 out of 10 due to its occasionally choppy performance. But for half price, it seems like a good deal.</p><p id=\"hBQhZj\">What you’re getting today for $299.99 is a modestly sized tablet with a convenient 3:2 aspect ratio screen, making it taller than 16:9 alternatives, which is better for note-taking and web browsing. Its included pen and keyboard case with a kickstand give it a Microsoft Surface-like setup, and its portable size makes it easier to hold for content consumption and touch-focused tablet tasks. Its Snapdragon 7c Gen 1 processor and 8GB of RAM aren’t killer specs, but it’s a serviceable tablet for an exceptional price today.</p><aside id=\"TBLsLS\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best Chromebook for 2022\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"buyYjV\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11148854\"></div></div><p id=\"5QCODC\">Here’s a deal if you’re in need of a good, portable Bluetooth speaker. The JBL Clip 4 is $49.95 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Clip-Built-Waterproof-JBLCLIP4BLKAM/dp/B08PHJW4BD/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and $49.99 at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg3RZseTN2V\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>. This cute speaker can clip onto a bag or easily hang on a hook or a beach umbrella when enjoying some time outside. Though, don’t let the small size fool you, as it puts out some big sound, especially for the money. It normally sells for $79.99, but this discount has it down to its lowest price yet. </p><p id=\"Pc66nT\">The Clip 4’s battery lasts for up to 10 hours of use, and its IP67-rated weather resistance ensures that it can survive the dust and water that it’s likely to encounter on your adventures. This little speaker makes for a great companion on hikes, bike rides, picnics, or even just working on projects around the house. It earned a spot in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23022617/best-bluetooth-speakers\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">our new list of the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy</a>, so what great timing for it to just cost $50, with spring and summer ahead of us.</p><div id=\"Cng2G3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11142141\"></div></div><p id=\"ovvC9O\">While there are lots of rumors and expectations for an Oculus Quest 3 or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/15/23027267/vergecast-elon-musk-twitter-buyout-meta-headset\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">whatever AR headsets may be eventually coming from Meta and Apple</a>, the Quest 2 still makes a compelling case to own one — especially when it’s discounted. You can pick up a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F393887911832%3Famdata%3Denc%253AAQAGAAAAkJHSnFrWO7GTeE5u7WdTxyfrJ7UwMQL0P7HYBBHp8lR6kxt%252FjwgJgXUW%252Fon76UMXuc4ZXWWsQ7%252BAf%252FZLGWTcAkHqFyH4IUsWXqzIzL4MbzAbBj1ZPfRoA8ZSB5eIHdPP90xD6gDNUlrrei0bWc5t0GozXveBfc70l7Jt7PwWfU6%252FaER1EBg6kDkfURgd8S9rmg%253D%253D%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals041822%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F4%2F18%2F23030043%2Fhp-chromebook-x2-chromeos-tablet-jbl-clip-meta-oculus-quest-2-evga-rtx-3070-ti-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">refurbished Oculus Quest 2 from an authorized Oculus dealer on eBay for $249</a>. That’s a $50 discount on the 128GB model, and this refurb also comes with a two-year warranty. There’s arguably no simpler or streamlined experience in the VR space than Meta’s Quest headset, and beyond games and fitness experiences like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/11/21254483/supernatural-oculus-quest-review-vr-fitness-within-interview\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Supernatural</em></a>, you can also use it to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/11/23020783/oculus-meta-quest-2-vr-headset-update-v39-studio-mountainside\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">change your scenery and chill out a bit</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"29iUzB\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10894909\"></div></div><p id=\"vJaK77\">While the world of new console restocks and buying a PS5 or Xbox Series X is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011418/microsoft-xbox-series-x-console-in-stock-stores-walmart-newegg-costco-availability-check-restock\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">very slowly improving</a>, graphics cards are starting to take the same turn. The top-shelf RTX 3090 and 3080 Ti cards of the world are still hard to get, but if you have your hopes and specifications set a bit lower, you can not only easily buy a mid-range Nvidia GPU today, but you can get a deal while you’re at it.</p><p id=\"Fl0fF1\">One such GPU is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B096WM6JFS/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">EVGA RTX 3070 Ti, which is currently selling on Amazon for $759.99</a>. This modest discount of $60 gets you a very capable card for fluid 1440p gaming, with 8GB of memory that supports DLSS upscaling and ray tracing — and it really beats paying gouged prices of well over $1,000 that we’ve seen for the past year and change. </p><p id=\"t78CeE\">EVGA has also outfitted it with some vibrant RGB lighting for those that like to show off the internal components of their PC. If you have a big enough case and are looking for a worthwhile upgrade or you’re undertaking a new build, this card is a great option. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22524897/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-test-benchmarks\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"sZzpbi\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11148897\"></div></div><h2 id=\"k8emCk\">Deals!
