Miller/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</figcaption>    </figure>  <p id=\"pSzEhh\">This spring, the University of Central Florida’s (UCF) football team will don QR codes instead of numbers on the back of their jerseys (via <a href=\"https://news.sportslogos.net/2022/04/15/ucf-knights-to-wear-qr-codes-on-spring-game-uniforms/college/\"><em>SportsLogos.net</em></a>). The team showed off their new garb <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UCF_Football/status/1514976666484887559\">on Twitter</a>, sporting large, custom QR codes beneath their last names that you can scan to access players’ biographies on UCF’s website.</p><div><div id=\"KPR6DP\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Custom QR codes for every player <br><br>4.16.22 Spring Game <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChargeOn?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ChargeOn</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/SuBYfp6yJC\">pic.twitter.com/SuBYfp6yJC</a></p>— UCF Football (@UCF_Football) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UCF_Football/status/1514979006457815040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></div><p id=\"4Jlynu\">In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoachGusMalzahn/status/1515061582727942163\">a video</a> posted by UCF coach Gus Malzahn (who also has a QR code stamped on his team <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UCF_Football/status/1514997881454923779\">polo shirt</a>) you can see how exactly the feature actually works. Judging by the video, it looks like UCF will display players’ QR codes on its home stadium’s jumbotron as well.</p><p id=\"Gwcph5\">Last year, the UCF Knights kept the numbers on the back of their jerseys but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UCF_Football/status/1380907202089791495\">swapped their last names</a> for Twitter handles. It’s probably best that the team kept their last names this time around, as I could see how it might be frustrating for fans to search for a player’s Twitter handle — or jersey number — just to find out their full name (if it isn’t already in their handle).</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"EiaPVA\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Scan in at the Bounce House tomorrow! <a href=\"https://t.co/n9Bu0Wt6e8\">pic.twitter.com/n9Bu0Wt6e8</a></p>— Coach Gus Malzahn (@CoachGusMalzahn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoachGusMalzahn/status/1515061582727942163?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div></div><p id=\"8GSFCM\">You may not associate modern technology with a team named after a medieval soldier, but it’s certainly a creative use of the QR code and a clever way to promote players. I’m just not sure how well it will work when you’re actually watching the game, though. </p><p id=\"BMZ653\">If you’re in the stands, are you supposed to zoom in extremely far on your phone while attempting to track a QR code that’s attached to a player sprinting across a field? And if you’re watching a broadcast or replay, will you just have to wait for a close-up? Of course, it is enough to attract media attention, and maybe get potential recruits to move the school up their list.</p><p id=\"94RqTk\"><em><strong>Update 3:45PM ET:</strong></em><em> Clarified this change is just for today’s spring game.</em></p>",
