It will also have its employees keep a watchful eye on Brazil’s 100 most popular channels, the <em>NYT </em>reports.</p><p id=\"xM14JI\">With over 1.1 million subscribers on the platform, Telegram has become a favored channel of communication for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who’s currently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-top-court-subpoenas-bolsonaro-leaked-documents-case-2022-01-27/\">under investigation for leaking police documents</a> and has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22909351/brazil-vaccines-bolsonaro-covid-19-misinformation\">spreading false information</a> in the past.</p><p id=\"iS5aTG\">Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes, an opponent of President Bolsonaro, ordered the ban on the app, which wound up lasting just two days. As Telegram CEO Pavel Durov explains, his company didn’t take action sooner because <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/18/22985737/telegram-brazil-supreme-court-ban-email-address-statement-durov\">they were checking the wrong email inbox</a> and failed to see the messages from Brazil’s Supreme Court.</p>",
