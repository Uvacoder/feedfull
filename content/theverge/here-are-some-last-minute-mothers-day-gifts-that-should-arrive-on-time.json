Even better, many of them are on sale, with a few products like Amazon’s 2021 Kindle Paperwhite and the second-gen Echo Show 8 selling at all-time lows. On top of that, you can even get free shipping, to boot.</p><p id=\"51Gtsh\">Below, we’ve curated a list of gifts for all budgets that should arrive in time for the holiday. And for those who leave shopping until the <em>very</em> last minute (no shame!), we’ve also included a couple of digital gifts that you can buy as late as Mother’s Day. </p><p id=\"yETxOQ\">And if you need more help (or you’d prefer to explore other options besides the ones listed here), be sure to also check out our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23011593/mothers-day-gift-ideas-2022-best-mom-tech-gadgets-tools\">complete Mother’s Day gift guide</a> or list of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/23045031/best-mothers-day-sales-deals-2022-tech-headphones-smart-displays\">best Mother’s Day deals</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c0QXPAEi5R_Y84vfLInMb3rqbQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954895/cgartenberg_211020_4803_0006.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The newest Kindle Paperwhite impressed us with its display and lengthy battery life.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"mVlHWf\">A few gifts that (should) arrive on time</h2><p id=\"m_-8179451835106308920Hmjjg6\">For book-loving moms, the latest Kindle Paperwhite is the ideal gift. She can lounge by the pool reading for hours without worrying about running out of battery, as the waterproof e-reader offers exceptionally long battery life. That’s in addition to other perks, including a 6.8-inch display that’s bigger than its predecessor, a USB-C charging port for easier recharging, and adjustable color temperature.</p><p id=\"1KsCKJ\">Regularly $139.99, the ad-supported model is <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/chaPgBq0dpB\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">selling for an all-time low of $99.99 at Best Buy</a> with free next-day shipping to boot, while <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NWHZM1M?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon has it for $104.99</a>. Just note only Amazon Prime members will receive the gift in time without having to pay extra. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong>.</a></p><div id=\"anzWGx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11172867\"></div></div><p id=\"HlnYAh\">If you don’t mind forking out an extra $200, you could alternatively buy Mom an iPad, which she could use as an e-reader as well as an everyday tablet, portable Netflix machine, and all-around entertainment and productivity gadget. The 2021 iPad is fast and powerful with its A13 Bionic CPU and its unique Center Stage feature, which keeps subjects centered in the frame during video calls. You can buy the base Wi-Fi model equipped with 64GB of storage for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$309.99 ($20 off) at Amazon</a>, although only Prime members will get it free in time for Mother’s Day.

If you want something that will last, plant-loving moms might appreciate Lego’s Bonsai Tree. With this unique gift, Mom can have fun building a cool bonsai tree made from Lego pieces, which she can then use to decorate the home. You can buy it for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Building-Project-Beautiful-Display/dp/B08HVXZW8X?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$40.33 instead of $49.99 from Amazon</a> and get it delivered by Mother’s Day for free if you’re a Prime member. If you’re not on Prime, you can also buy the Lego tree at its full price from <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cha65gvQgYU\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and have it shipped in time as well.</p><div id=\"tYM5Sf\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11178086\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OFdANYL11-bM-MdfsbZdGMJXxwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641648/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_6.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The second-gen Echo Show 8 is our favorite smart display.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"oNoSmL\">Smart displays are popular gifts for good reason. Mom can use Amazon’s excellent second-gen Echo Show 8 smart display for a variety of use cases, whether that’s as a digital photo frame, to watch videos, control other smart home devices, or play music. She can even use the Alexa-enabled smart display to make Zoom calls with the new and improved 13-megapixel camera. Normally $129.99, the Echo Show 8 is on sale at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cha6wceUwF9\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-8-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> for $89.99, an all-time low. It’ll be delivered on Mother’s Day when you get it from Best Buy, but you’ll have to pay extra if you’re not an Amazon Prime member when purchasing it from Amazon. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong>.</a></p><div id=\"flfQmN\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11177123\"></div></div><p id=\"TUIeV5\">Instant cameras like Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 11 Instant Camera offer a fun and fast way to capture great memories. The Instax Square Mini 11 prints small, wallet-size photos within a couple of seconds after taking the shot. It also boasts extra features like a selfie mode so Mom can take a picture using the camera’s onboard mirror and pull-out lens. This cute camera includes five shutter button accessories. Plus, the camera’s relatively quick and simple to set up and use — a perk that less tech-savvy moms may appreciate. All said, it’s a great gift that <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/chaOkx6lwss\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy is currently selling in various colors for $69.99 instead of $79.99</a> with free shipping as well.</p><div id=\"SpSJ8K\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11177218\"></div></div><aside id=\"pC8Ys6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo is finally more camera than toy\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22989946/fujifilm-instax-mini-evo-instant-camera-review-test-photography\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"dgmBED\">Booking a one-hour massage for Mom is nice, but gifting a Theragun Mini massager means she can always treat herself to R&amp;R whenever and wherever she’d like. This powerful, three-speed massager makes it easy to give herself an excellent soft tissue massage while relaxing at home. It’s also small and quiet, so she can even carry it around whenever she needs some relief. You can buy it right now in time for <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cha6uyF4C2V\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mother’s Day from Best Buy for $159.99 instead of $199.99</a>.

We consider these comfortable, lightweight buds some of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best true wireless earbuds you can buy</a>. While they lack active noise cancellation, they offer everything else Mom may need in a pair of earbuds, including reliable performance, easy-to-use controls, and lengthy battery life. You can get these delivered in time for the holiday at Best Buy and Walmart and, if you’re an Amazon Prime member, from Amazon, as well. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong>.</a></p><div id=\"WOq6VC\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11178041\"></div></div><p id=\"yskkDi\">If you’re fine with spending a bit extra, you can buy the Beats Fit Pro in time for Mother’s Day as well. Unlike Jabra’s Elite 3, they offer active noise cancellation and sound quality that’s on par with the AirPods Pro. Being more workout-focused, they are also designed to securely stay in Mom’s ears while she exercises, so this is a good gift for fitness fans. You can get them on time for the holiday when you buy the earbuds for <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cha8xHSJbT9\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$179.99 ($20 off) from Best Buy</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Fit-Pro-Cancelling-Built/dp/B09JL41N9C?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> if you’re a Prime member.</p><div id=\"LKT0k3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11178242\"></div></div><p id=\"h5LP8C\">Like the Beats Fit Pro, Fitbit’s Versa 3 is another great present for fitness enthusiasts or those moms simply trying to stay healthy. Currently $179.99 ($51 off), it’s far more affordable than an Apple Watch while tracking many of the same activities, offering built-in GPS, and working with both iOS and Android. The tracker also comes with other nice perks, including support for NFC payments, the option of either Alexa or Google Assistant, and lengthy battery life. You can get the Fitbit Versa 3 in time for Mother’s Day when you buy it from <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cha7i8S9Kdu\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy for $179.99</a>. Amazon Prime members can also buy the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W2GKGR4/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">purple tracker for around the same price</a> and have it shipped in time for the holiday.</p><div id=\"L0RGci\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11178105\"></div></div><h2 id=\"iIhBkQ\">Last-minute digital gifts you can buy on short notice</h2><p id=\"NpYgcc\">Being a mom is one of the hardest, most stressful jobs in the world. Express your appreciation by giving Mom the gift of relaxation by buying her a subscription to meditation or a mindfulness app like like <a href=\"https://www.calm.com/gift-card\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Calm</a> or <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.headspace.com%2Fbuy%2Fgift&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F5%2F5%2F23057432%2Fmothers-day-tech-gifts-ideas-amazon-kindle-apple-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Headspace</a>. It’s a great alternative if it’s either too late to buy a Theragun Mini massage or that’s simply out of your budget. You can buy Mom a one-year Calm or Headspace subscription for $69.99 or a couple of months of Headspace for $12.99 per month if that’s too pricey for you.</p><div id=\"G8Xcd6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11177075\"></div></div><div id=\"wyAQ63\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11177076\"></div></div><p id=\"Bsig0I\">Speaking of health and wellness, health-conscious moms may also appreciate a Peloton subscription. The company <a href=\"https://www.onepeloton.com/app\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">offers thousands of on-demand fitness classes for $12.99 per month</a> — and you don’t need to own a Peloton bike or treadmill to attend.
