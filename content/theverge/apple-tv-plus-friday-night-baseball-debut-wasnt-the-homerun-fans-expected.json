The streaming service aired the New York Mets against the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros against the Los Angeles Angels last night, and I think the fans of all four teams can agree on one thing: Apple TV Plus’ Friday Night Baseball debut <em>did not</em> go down as expected.</p><p id=\"LkttRK\">For starters, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KleinDriveHomer/status/1512577225790566407\">a</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PEEPLEGRAVITY/status/1512584612437929989\">number</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NJDavidD/status/1512584475686936579\">of</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KFCBarstool/status/1512584305071083520\">fans</a> said their broadcasts were interrupted during the games, despite their internet working just fine. When the stream cut out, viewers got an error message that read: “There’s a problem loading this video. If this continues, check your internet connection.” It looks like Apple may have been having some widespread connectivity issues, but there hasn’t been any confirmation from the company. Apple didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p><div id=\"uvPqs2\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nothing can ruin baseball… and then Apple TV + came along</p>— Evan Roberts (@EvanRobertsWFAN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvanRobertsWFAN/status/1512619688760688645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"Ae1Gvn\">When fans could actually watch the game, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IvanTheK/status/1512607425114697728\">some</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joefaz1026/status/1512625405798322183\">said</a> they put it on mute due to the distracting, and sometimes blatantly off-topic commentary.

To Apple’s credit, the company <em>does</em> say these controls aren’t supported during Friday Night Baseball on <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213099\">its site</a>, but it would still be a handy feature to have.</p><div id=\"1AojuD\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+ (which is produced by MLB Network) feels like watching the MLB App on an iPad. <br><br>Simple and clean gfx.

Others <a href=\"https://twitter.com/briantong/status/1512622383995121667\">pointed</a> out the clean, simplistic on-screen graphics, like the subtle name of the player at bat and probability statistics in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Brandon Costa, the director of digital at Sports Video Group, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SVG_Brandon/status/1512595444374941696\">highlighted</a> the use of the sans-serif font Apple typically uses for its marketing materials (called <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/visual-design/typography/\">“San Francisco”</a> for all you font nerds), making it a very Apple-meets-MLB type of experience.</p><p id=\"fpgU3v\">Apple first announced its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22967483/apple-tv-plus-friday-night-baseball\">partnership with the MLB</a> at its Peek Performance event last month. In addition to broadcasting live baseball, Apple TV Plus gives fans access to replays and is also set to air <em>MLB Big Inning</em>, a show that features highlights and analysis surrounding the latest games in baseball. Live baseball games are available for free on the Apple TV app <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213099https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213099\">for a limited time</a>, but it’s unclear when Apple plans on requiring a subscription for all viewers.</p>",
