It <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.doordash.com%2Fdashpass%2Fstudent&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F4%2F11%2F23019993%2Fdoordash-dashpass-students-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">costs $4.99 a month</a>, half that of its <a href=\"https://help.doordash.com/consumers/s/article/What-is-DashPass?language=en_US\">regular $9.99 DashPass subscription</a>, and offers similar benefits including: free delivery on eligible orders over a minimum threshold (generally $12 for restaurants and $25 for grocery orders); 5 percent credit back on pickup orders from certain restaurants; and access to other members-only promotions.</p><p id=\"5vjwpN\">DoorDash’s announcement says the student membership will be available to “all undergraduate and graduate students at accredited colleges and universities in the US,” and it’s <a href=\"https://www.sheerid.com/shoppers/\">working with SheerID</a> to verify student status. Its website adds that subscribers are free to “<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.doordash.com%2Fdashpass%2Fstudent&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F4%2F11%2F23019993%2Fdoordash-dashpass-students-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cancel anytime</a>,” with no fees or penalty for cancellation. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"P6ReWd\"><q>DashPass normally costs $9.99 a month</q></aside></div><p id=\"kjt7ks\">Subscriptions like these are typically offered as a way of shoring up loyalty from customers who have an ever-increasing range of delivery apps to choose from. Uber offers a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787130/uber-one-membership-subscription-discounts-ride-food-delivery\">subscription of its own for $9.99 a month</a>, which includes similar free delivery options on Uber Eats in addition to perks with Uber’s ride-hailing service. Grubhub also offers a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.grubhub.com%2Fplus&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F4%2F11%2F23019993%2Fdoordash-dashpass-students-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$9.99 monthly subscription</a>.</p><p id=\"8ufAoN\">By focusing on students, DoorDash is hoping to cash in on a lucrative section of the market. It cites a recent survey that suggested 70 percent of college students use a delivery app at least once a week — and that they average four orders every seven days. That’s a lot of delivery fees that students could cut out with DoorDash’s new, more affordable, subscription.</p>",
