According to a complaint filed by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the iPhone-maker violated federal labor laws by interrogating workers about union activity, prohibiting employees from posting union flyers in shared spaces, and forcing workers to attend anti-union presentations. </p><p id=\"YwZbRp\">It’s the second time the CWA has accused Apple of union-busting activity this week, with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/17/23093570/apple-accused-union-busting-unfair-labor-practice-atlanta\">similar complaints filed in Atlanta</a> on Tuesday. These complaints form part of a wave of union organization in retail and tech sectors, including the successful <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/1/23004524/amazon-workers-vote-union-jfk8-staten-island-new-york-warehouse-win\">unionization of an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island</a>. Three Apple stores have officially <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/03/apple-retail-towson-union-labor-machinists/\">launched union drives</a> so far, though Apple does not currently have any retail unions in the US. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"CJGmXa\"><q>Apple’s alleged union-busting tactics include mandatory anti-union meetings</q></aside></div><p id=\"Lm531q\">Details of the New York City labor complaint against Apple, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-18/apple-accused-by-union-of-illegal-tactics-at-new-york-city-store\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-world-trade-center-union-busting-complaint-060937009.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHpF8zVZ4p2vWhmjOXbaJuyYycZqvSHiyrDdg3XDzIk9q1GkfMcKyDMqGh5uhI9BdY2UFeFhW-tOGpLA9QRuW4fXDTkqnHjnKToTgCOrSamYnwFJ9_0Qz9iUJG55ycijCKwcZqJUMrFE-s42Ezx3SAMaGE8RTmv4YbiTyA4f_Efe\"><em>Engadget</em></a>, included accusations that Apple holds “captive audience” meetings — mandatory meetings with anti-union messages. In the past, such meetings have been allowed up until 24 hours before a union vote, but the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) <a href=\"https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-general-counsel-jennifer-abruzzo-issues-memo-on-captive-audience-and\">recently changed position</a> on this issue, saying captive audience meetings are coercive and a violation of federal labor law. </p><p id=\"qZ9H7f\">Regarding the filing at the World Trade Center store, Tim Dubnau, the deputy organizing director of the CWA, said in a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-world-trade-center-union-busting-complaint-060937009.html\">press statement</a>: “Apple retail workers across the country are demanding a voice on the job and a seat at the table. Unfortunately, and in contradiction to its stated values, Apple has responded like a typical American corporation with heavy-handed tactics designed to intimidate and coerce workers. The best thing Apple can do is allow workers to choose for themselves whether or not they want a union.”</p><p id=\"c40Rps\">Although Apple has not taken a public stance on unionization in its stores, it has been distributing anti-union talking points to managers (<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7v8qp/leaked-memo-reveals-apples-anti-union-talking-points-for-store-managers\">according to a report by <em>Vice</em></a>) and has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23041632/apple-hires-anti-union-lawyers-littler-mendelson-union-fight-cwa\">hired lawyers from Littler Mendelson</a> (a firm known for anti-union cases that previously defended McDonalds against alleged violations of labor law and is currently representing Starbucks in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949417/outlook-crash-error-delay-starbucks-anti-union-lawyers-new-york-deadline\">its own anti-union battle</a>). </p>",
