Jeff Bezos quoted a <em>New York Times</em> reporter’s tweet pointing out that Tesla’s business interests in China could give the government leverage over Twitter via its new owner, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1518734031566778368\">saying</a>, “Interesting question.

However, unlike most, he owns the <em>Washington Post</em> and has a net worth ($177.5 billion) vaguely within Elon’s range ($264.6 billion). </p><p id=\"hAVvnG\">Reports <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/technology/elon-musk-twitter-regulators.html\">suggest</a> Elon’s purchase should close without much regulatory trouble, but pushing the angle of possible undue influence from a foreign government is one way you could gum up the works... if you had a few billion dollars and some <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021\">extra time on your hands</a>. Of course, as Elon once told me, “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1000503343007989761\">Twitter is fun</a>,” and maybe this is just how billionaires joke, like poking each other on Facebook or something.
