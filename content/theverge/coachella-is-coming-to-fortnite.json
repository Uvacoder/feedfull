The annual music festival announced today that it’s partnering with developer Epic Games to release Coachella-themed skins and in-game features for its first foray into gaming.</p><p id=\"9S8OSH\">These days, Coachella is equally known for its performances as it is for the outfits attendees wear — so it’s fitting that both are coming to <em>Fortnite</em>. Coachella will release two series of skins to coincide with weekends one and two of the music festival, beginning April 14th and April 22nd. The outfits, inspired by the Coachella style, react to music playing in the game. The first group of items goes on sale in the <em>Fortnite</em> shop at 8PM ET tonight.</p><p id=\"Ffjexy\">In addition to the skins, Coachella will also do a takeover of the in-game Icon Radio, and players will be able to listen to music by over 30 artists from this year’s festival lineup while in <em>Fortnite</em> vehicles. </p><p id=\"vLCMLx\">While this is the first time Coachella will come to the game, it’s far from the first music partnership. <em>Fortnite</em> has focused more on music and live events in the last few years: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music\">Marshmello</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling\">Ariana Grande</a> have performed, and artists have been part of musical events <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550240/fortnite-easy-life-concert-o2-arena\">built</a> in the game’s creative mode. Epic even <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike\">built a studio</a> for in-game concerts, saying the Fortnite stage should be considered a tour stop.</p><p id=\"fVQeLP\">The <em>Fortnite</em> partnership is part of a larger push by Coachella this year toward digital festival components. The festival has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22912255/coachella-lifetime-passes-nfts\">released</a> <a href=\"https://nft.coachella.com/marketplace\">several rounds</a> of NFTs and mobile AR features for attendees in the lead-up to the festival.</p>",
