However, the company today <a href=\"https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2022/04/roku-reaches-multi-year-extension-of-agreement-with-amazon/lg7pkcax-1649077261\">announced an extension in its deal with Amazon</a>, ensuring that the Prime Video and IMDb TV apps will maintain a presence on Roku devices without any back-and-forth wrangling, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445118/roku-nbc-tv-everywhere-channels-peacock-streaming-distribution-comcast\">threats</a>, or mudslinging that delayed the rollout of HBO Max and Peacock and caused YouTube TV’s app to disappear for a while.</p><p id=\"sbPd7j\"><strong>Roku:</strong></p><blockquote><p id=\"ql3OqN\">Roku and Amazon have reached a multi-year extension for their distribution agreement. Customers can continue to access the Prime Video and IMDb TV apps on their Roku devices.</p></blockquote><aside id=\"sNtdX5\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Roku is in the ad business, not the hardware business, says CEO\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17595384/roku-ceo-anthony-wood-ads-hardware-business-interview-business-model\"},{\"title\":\"Does Amazon even know what it’s buying with the MGM acquisition? \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22567113/amazon-mgm-deal-chaos-reigns\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"F2z7ba\">There’s no indication of a disagreement there or change in data sharing, even as Amazon pumps up its free IMDb TV offering with content from the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22979800/amazon-mgm-merger-completed-prime-studios\">recently closed $8 billion purchase of MGM</a> and prepares high-profile streaming content on Prime Video, like its new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891258/lord-of-the-rings-of-power-amazon-prime-video-lotr\"><em>The Lord of the Rings</em> series</a>. Meanwhile, it presumably means <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508345/roku-channel-amazon-fire-tv-streaming-free-live-tv-advertising-revenue\">Roku’s ad-supported channel will continue to stream on the Fire TV platform</a>, and its boxes will remain in stock on Amazon’s website.</p><p id=\"wu1BSy\">As Roku CEO Anthony Wood <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17594738/vergecast-podcast-314-google-eu-macbook-pro-benchmarks-roku-ceo-anthony-wood\">explained on an episode of the <em>Vergecast</em></a>, its business model is to take some of the ad inventory of ad-supported channels (like IMDb TV) that stream on its platform to sell targeted ads. Some publishers have their own plans for targeting, and that causes friction, as suggested in a report by <em>The Information</em> last fall noting the two could have an issue if Amazon wanted access to detailed viewing data it could link to its customers. </p>",
