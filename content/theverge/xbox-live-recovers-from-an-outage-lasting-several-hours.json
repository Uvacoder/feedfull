Some players were unable to start Cloud Gaming sessions, launch digital games, make purchases, or even access streaming apps including Netflix and Disney Plus.</p><p id=\"M6BLLg\">Although Xbox <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XboxSupport/status/1522836465503326208\">seemed to resolve these problems</a>, it looks like issues with its store, digital titles, and Cloud Gaming resurfaced Saturday night. Players should’ve been able to <a href=\"https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/connect-network/using-xbox-one-offline\">play games offline</a> during the outage with their Xbox set as their <a href=\"https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/my-home-xbox\">“home” console</a>, however, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vicious696/status/1523084391181787136\">some</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dreams22x/status/1523076975618772992\">reported</a> that Xbox still prompted them to sign in to play their own games. As my colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1523251619814649857\">Tom Warren points out</a>, this issue calls attention to Microsoft’s DRM policy that makes it harder, if not impossible, to play purchased digital games offline.</p><p id=\"j9pIqS\"><em><strong>Update, May 7th 5:45PM ET: </strong></em><em>Updated to add that rebooting your Xbox console may help resolve some issues.</em></p><p id=\"CelAfz\"><em><strong>Update, May 8th 8:18AM ET:</strong></em><em> Updated to reflect that the outage has been resolved, and added some additional information for context surrounding Microsoft’s DRM policy.</em></p>",
