It also appears that the cards you put into your Wallet will be accessible from elsewhere, as the screenshots show a link saying “learn how passes in your Wallet will appear across Google.”</p><div id=\"gTM3im\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">More screenshots, including a peek at the new Wallet icon. <a href=\"https://t.co/zmHcRs915B\">pic.twitter.com/zmHcRs915B</a></p>— Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1516038670112935936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 18, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"5nDgp8\">Google Wallet <a href=\"https://mashable.com/archive/google-mobile-payment-system-liveblog\">started as Google’s NFC payment app</a> in 2011, acting as a place for you to store payment cards digitally. Over its life, it evolved as a digital (and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/31/11340330/google-wallet-debit-card-shut-down\">sometimes physical</a>) payment service over the years to become sort of a Venmo competitor before it was folded together with Android pay to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17031634/google-pay-android-app-credit-card-wallet\">create Google Pay</a> in 2018. That app has since been <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21571806/google-pay-relaunch-money-payments-finances-deals-offers-banking-plex\">totally revamped</a>, turning into much more than an app you use to send friends money and store your digital cards. </p><p id=\"ErE3jb\">That transition has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21718805/google-pay-old-apps-website-payment-features-discontinuing-2021\">been confusing for some</a>, and the fact that Google Pay is trying to handle <em>everything</em> related to payments (Google even planned on launching a banking service for it, but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704500/google-pay-plex-canceled-checking-savings-accounts\">the project was scrapped</a>) probably doesn’t help. If Google is bringing back Wallet as a separate location to manage your cards, it could help focus the Google Pay experience back towards paying at stores and sending friends money.</p>",
