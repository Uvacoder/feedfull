According to <em>9to5</em>’s report, you’ll be able to get a cellular version of the wearable, and it will have a 300 milliamp-hour (mAh) battery.</p><p id=\"yaLOZS\">It wasn’t necessarily a given that there would be a cellular option for the Pixel Watch. Some <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fwithings-scanwatch-hybrid-smartwatch-with-ecg-heart-rate-and-oximeter-42mm-black%2F6397107.p%3FskuId%3D6397107&amp;sharedid=theverge.com\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lower-end smartwatches</a>, and even some <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22934516/garmin-epix-2-review\">high-end fitness-focused models</a>, are reliant on your phone for connectivity. If the rumor is accurate and there is a cellular Pixel Watch model, it reinforces the idea that Google’s probably not trying to make its watch a smaller or cheaper alternative — it wants that mass-market appeal. </p><p id=\"IOACrS\">As for the battery, its physical capacity seems about right for how big the watch is. However, it’s almost impossible to tell what that milliamp-hour rating means for how long it’ll last between charges. </p><p id=\"rQcpYv\">When <em>The Verge</em>’s reviews editor Dan Seifert compared the Apple Watch Series 7 41mm and the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic 42mm, he found that they had dramatically different levels of endurance. One day, the Galaxy Watch was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1511857928696905735?s=20&amp;t=mbC1do1JMr45pth3tBMteg\">out of juice</a> while the Apple Watch was at 52 percent (though the next day he was able to get <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1512234221657632769?s=20&amp;t=mbC1do1JMr45pth3tBMteg\">a couple of hours more</a> out of the Galaxy after some tweaks). And yet the Apple Watch’s battery isn’t <em>that </em>much bigger; it has a 284mAh capacity, while the Galaxy’s battery is rated for 247mAh. </p><div id=\"XNNYNM\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">8:05pm<br><br>Galaxy Watch 4: 0% dead and shutdown<br><br>Apple Watch Series 7: 52%</p>— Dan S. (@dcseifert) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1511857928696905735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 7, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"KoBeMM\">What really matters when it comes to a wearable’s battery life are its features and processor. Both are unknown at this point for the Pixel Watch, though features-wise it obviously won’t have the e-paper display that let the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/3/8139835/pebble-time-steel-smartstrap-announcement-launch\">Pebble Time</a> get well over a week of use out of its 250mAh battery. </p><p id=\"hMzATN\">The big, as-of-yet unanswered question is which chip Google will use — Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 4100 or 4100 Plus, which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632101/fossil-gen-6-smartwatch-leak-wear-os-snapdragon-4100-price-release-date-specs\">haven’t shown up in a lot of watches</a> despite having <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307368/qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-google-wear-os-smartwatch-wearables-faster-battery-life\">been around for a while</a>? A currently unannounced <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/qualcomms-feeling-the-heat-over-its-android-smartwatch-1847336735\">next-gen Qualcomm chip</a>? Samsung’s Exynos chips <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22618532/galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-price-specs-features\">that it uses in its own watches</a>? A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details\">custom Tensor processor</a>, like Google uses in the Pixel 6? There are so many options — some of which are unknowns, and others that would be a bad sign for its battery life. </p><p id=\"jf2T6x\">Hopefully, we won’t have to wait too long to find out the answer — the rumors say that Google could announce the Pixel Watch at its I/O conference, which starts just a few weeks from now <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981868/google-i-o-2022-may-11th-12th-online-virtual\">on May 11th</a>. If you want to get a look at its hardware before then, though, you’re in luck — someone posted a plethora of pictures of it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/26/23043793/pixel-watch-leak-continues-wrist-strap-images\">on</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/24/23039835/google-pixel-watch-leak-photos-prototype-left-at-restaurant\">off</a> a wrist, claiming that a friend found the device laying around in a bar, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_4#Gizmodo_leak\">iPhone 4-style</a>. Maybe Sundar Pichai will make the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/z__jxoczNWc?t=98\">same joke as Steve Jobs</a> when he announces the Pixel Watch, saying “stop me if you’ve already seen this.”</p>",
