That also means users could access content blocked in their countries like, for instance, Netflix or Hulu shows.</p><aside id=\"Ytt1zB\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Microsoft rides the cloud, Office and Windows to sustained growth in Q3 2022\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/26/23043334/microsoft-q3-2022-earnings-revenue-cloud-windows-xbox-gaming-surface\"},{\"title\":\"Windows 11 basics: how to use System Restore to go back in time\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23046505/windows-11-system-restore-microsoft-how-to\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"7rZjvN\">There’s a catch for this free service, though. Data use is limited to 1GB per month, and users will need to be signed in to a Microsoft account so the company can, well, ironically track their usage. </p><p id=\"rRPYBa\">Microsoft adds that while Cloudflare will collect support and diagnostic information from the service, the company will permanently get rid of that data every 25 hours.</p><p id=\"OgtT3Q\">While the feature is still under development and not yet available for early testing either, Microsoft detailed how users could try out a preview. That suggests it could roll out soon to one of the Microsoft Edge Insider channels first, which users can <a href=\"https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download\">download and join here</a>. </p><p id=\"ZnYopr\">Once it does, you can try out the preview version by opening up Edge, heading to <strong>Settings and more</strong>,<strong> </strong>and clicking on <strong>Secure Network.</strong></p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1kQGSJloouRm1fqcEznMlvLyQ4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23426581/MicrosoftSecureNetworkTurnOn.png\">      <cite>Image: Microsoft</cite>      <figcaption><em>Click on “Secure Network” to turn the VPN service on.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"rwNpKf\">At that point, users will be prompted to sign in to or create a Microsoft Account. After doing so, a solid shield icon will appear in the browser frame, indicating Microsoft’s Edge Secure Network is now turned on. It will turn off after the user closes the browser.</p><p id=\"lbHf6C\">Microsoft is one of many browsers that offer some kind of VPN service. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/21/11477036/free-vpn-opera-web-browser\">Opera comes with a free one</a> as well, but more popular browsers like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325316/mozilla-vpn-android-windows-launch-firefox-private-network-price\">Mozilla only offer a paid VPN service</a>, as does <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21541032/google-one-vpn-cloud-storage-subscription\">Google Chrome</a>, thereby potentially help improving Edge’s value proposition. </p><aside id=\"ad-zone-size-container-div-gpt-ad-1494450502098-ccr3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Firefox’s anti-tracking feature adds per-account VPN for more privacy\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914078/mozilla-vpn-multi-account-containers-add-on\"},{\"title\":\"How to use Apple’s Private Relay feature with iCloud Plus\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"xAayB2\"></p>",
