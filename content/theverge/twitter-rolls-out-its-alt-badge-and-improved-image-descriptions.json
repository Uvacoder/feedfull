Images that have text descriptions will get a badge that reads “alt,” and clicking on the badge will bring up the description. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22969304/twitter-image-description-alt-text-test-accessibility\">Twitter first announced</a> changes were coming last month.</p><p id=\"0zj2qL\">“As promised, the ALT badge and exposed image descriptions go global today,” reads a tweet from Twitter’s Accessibility account. “Over the past month, we fixed bugs and gathered feedback from the limited release group. We’re ready. You’re ready. Let’s describe our images!”</p><div id=\"NUFYyZ\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As promised, the ALT badge and exposed image descriptions go global today.<br> <br>Over the past month, we fixed bugs and gathered feedback from the limited release group.

The company didn’t have a dedicated accessibility team until late 2020, with workers who wanted to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers\">work on accessibility issues volunteering</a> their time. </p>",
