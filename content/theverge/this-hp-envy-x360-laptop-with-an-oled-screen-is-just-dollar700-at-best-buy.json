The deals capping off this week run the gamut from laptops and graphics cards to soundbars. Kicking things off, we have a noteworthy sale on the HP Envy x360 13-inch convertible laptop that has a gorgeous OLED screen. Normally this configuration costs $1,049.99, but it <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgZhF21u0Cj\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has been discounted to $699.99 at Best Buy</a>. This is the lowest price we’ve ever seen for this model, which definitely warrants your attention.</p><p id=\"sRxJvj\">This flexible 2-in-1 laptop is equipped with an 11th Generation Intel Core i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of built-in storage. This isn’t the most powerful laptop out there, but it’s more than enough juice for most apps. Plus, if you need a versatile, mobile machine that’s particularly great for watching movies and TV shows, its 1080p OLED screen is tough to beat. The Envy x360 has a pair of USB-A ports and a single Thunderbolt 4 port to connect the laptop to an external monitor or a speedy SSD. It also has a microSD card slot that offers an additional avenue for data transfers, but it can also provide the laptop with additional storage if you need the extra space.  </p><div id=\"sCb3rb\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10730286\"></div></div><p id=\"ysPSRc\">This isn’t something we typically feature on <em>Verge Deals</em> due to them quickly going in and out of stock, but we thought this deal on the <a href=\"https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-R66EAGLE-8GD/sp#sp\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gigabyte Radeon RX6600 GPU</a> was worth pointing out. Not only is this card readily available, but you can currently purchase it for less than its original $399.99 price. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GIGABYTE-Graphics-WINDFORCE-Cooling-GV-R66EAGLE-8GD/dp/B09J2NCD2L?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon has this graphics card available for a modest discount of $369.99</a>.</p><p id=\"D1LZLi\">The Gigabyte model of the RX 6600 offers 8GB of VRAM and a base clock speed of 2,044 MHz. While specs like these won’t be able to handle 4K rendering, they’re perfectly suited for playing games at 1440p with compromises or for playing titles at 1080p with faster frame rates. This model of the RX 6600 also adopts a triple fan design, which, provided you’ve got room in your case, can provide a little more headroom for overclocking.</p><div id=\"HIoRvl\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11133632\"></div></div><p id=\"khv35C\">If you’re looking to fill out your collection and don’t mind physical games taking up shelf space, GameStop is currently having a buy two, get one free sale on all pre-owned games. This promotion is exactly what it says on the tin: get a free game when you purchase two others of equal or greater value. Events like these are always a great opportunity to grab games that you may have slept on for a bit, but you can even grab newly released titles here. Some of the highlights available here include <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Felden-ring----playstation-5%2F297831.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fproducts%2Fhalo-infinite---xbox-series-x%2F224750.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fproducts%2Fforza-horizon-5---xbox-series-x%2F298223.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a>.
