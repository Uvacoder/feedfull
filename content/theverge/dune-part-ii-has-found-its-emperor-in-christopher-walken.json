It was obvious that Villeneuve was holding some things back to surprise audiences with in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22739098/dune-part-two-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-paul-atreides-spice-sandworm\">Legendary’s second <em>Dune </em>movie</a>, and the latest bit of casting news suggests that the director knows what he’s doing.</p><p id=\"kjbDmJ\"><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/05/dune-part-2-christopher-walken-the-emperor-1235021590/\"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a> that Christopher Walken has signed on to <em>Dune: Part II </em>to portray the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV who is initially responsible for sending Paul Atreides’ father Leto to the planet Arrakis. In Herbert’s novel, House Harkonnen and the emperor are both shocked when they learn of the Fremen’s continued resistance on Arrakis following an attempt at eliminating House Atreides. Considering how <em>Dune: Part II </em>is meant to cover elements from the book that the first film didn’t get around to, the emperor’s not going to be the only interesting new part of the story. But he’ll definitely be one of the most important parts when <em>Dune: Part II </em>hits theaters on October 20th, 2023.</p><p id=\"3NYRhQ\"></p>",
