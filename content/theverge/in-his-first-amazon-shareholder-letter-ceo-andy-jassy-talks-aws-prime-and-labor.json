The letter starts by extolling Amazon Web Services’ role in helping businesses during the pandemic — familiar subject matter for Jassy, whose <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos\">previous role was as CEO of AWS</a>. The letter also discusses familiar subjects like supply chain disruption, labor shortages, and Amazon’s focus on getting out more Prime packages <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22622087/amazon-kentucky-air-hub-opens-faster-deliveries-prime\">faster</a>.</p><p id=\"WG9cdP\">Labor is a hot-button topic for Amazon right now. Beyond the difficulty of getting new employees, Jassy does address <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/12/23022107/amazon-warehouse-injuries-us-half\">reports that the company has significantly higher injury rates</a> than the industry average for warehouse workers by saying that it’s working to systematically solve “the top 100 employee experience pain points.” But Jassy is silent on the topic of labor organization. Amazon is currently in the middle of two disputed unionization elections, one in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23004479/amazon-workers-vote-results-union-bessemer-warehouse-challenged-ballots-results\">Bessemer, Alabama</a> (where <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/7/23015822/union-objections-amazon-bessemer-alabama-election-redo\">the union objected</a> to Amazon’s actions against campaigners), the other in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/1/23004524/amazon-workers-vote-union-jfk8-staten-island-new-york-warehouse-win\">Staten Island, New York</a> (where <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/8/23017252/amazon-alu-union-eleciton-objections-filing\">Amazon objected</a> following the union’s historic win). Another union election <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/18/22985518/amazon-warehouse-union-election-second-staten-island-ldj5\">is slated to start</a> at its LDJ5 facility on April 25th.</p><p id=\"CnB2D1\">You can read the <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2021-letter-to-shareholders\">full shareholder letter here</a>. It’s lengthy, and how much value you get from it will depend on how interested you are in Amazon’s business, but it could provide some insight into the tone Jassy is trying to set for his tenure at Amazon.
