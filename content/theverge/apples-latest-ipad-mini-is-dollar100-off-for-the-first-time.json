The most impressive (and unexpected) deal is on Apple’s 2021 iPad Mini, which received a design overhaul similar to the iPad Air. Normally $499.99 for the 64GB Wi-Fi version, you can get it for just $399.99 today at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G91LXFP?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg9OIXnjIHb\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-2021-model%2F-%2FA-84619867&amp;sharedid=Vergedeals050222\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>. That beats the best-ever price by nearly $50. Given that it’s such an aggressive, out-of-nowhere deal, this one might see some color options sell out quickly. And if you’re interested in more storage, the 256GB configuration is $100 off, too, costing $549.99 instead of $649.99.</p><p id=\"4KIwHK\">The 2021 iPad Mini features an 8.3-inch display and is powered by the A15 Bionic chipset. One of the big advantages that it has over the more affordable base iPad is its USB-C charging port, which allows for broader compatibility with accessories. The second-generation Apple Pencil can snap onto its side to recharge to boot. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"ThPcOx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10743705\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8xbOW3TCu9GIM0PRtzHPNTAvRUs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19882515/2020040516283500_02CB906EA538A35643C1E1484C4B947D.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite>  </figure><p id=\"SQ5Wx4\">It’s also a banner day for Nintendo Switch owners who haven’t yet purchased <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>. The chill game where you craft, meet fellow islanders, catch bugs, and more is down to $39.99 at <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=VergeDeals050222&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fanimal-crossing-new-horizons---nintendo-switch%2F179366.html\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GameStop</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg9OH5Q4xGf\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fanimal-crossing--new-horizons---8211--nintendo-switch--no-aasa%2F-%2FA-76780148&amp;sharedid=Vergedeals050222\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>. The game usually costs $59.99, and, among Nintendo’s exclusive titles for the Switch, price drops haven’t taken this game below $15 off. But today you can get $20 off the title in either digital or physical versions. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"0JKm4v\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9514849\"></div></div><p id=\"sy3LLl\">While on the topic of Switch games, <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> is also seeing a return to its lowest price. Normally $79.99 (and at one point, extremely tough to find at the normal price earlier in the pandemic), it’s now $54.99 at <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F434503657&amp;sharedid=Vergedeals050222\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fring-fit-adventure-nintendo-switch%2F-%2FA-76593324&amp;sharedid=Vergedeals050222\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cglfOk2zqUH\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XV4NHHN?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>. This game includes a pilates ring, and, with its single-player campaign, it will have you stretching, doing yoga poses, squats, and more to defeat enemies. It’s a surprisingly fun (and physically engaging) experience. The kit includes a leg strap, which you’ll also be able to use with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/27/23044617/nintendo-switch-sports-wii-sports-party-game\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nintendo Switch Sports</em></a> to play soccer.</p><div id=\"TZOsYk\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10273326\"></div></div><p id=\"58RKEQ\">The good deals aren’t stopping yet. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HF1DC1J/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-7-GPS-41mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-Regular%2F336891071&amp;subid1=TheVergeBestAppleWatchDealsMarch152022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg9OCn7s0lH\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> are hosting a great price on the 41mm Apple Watch Series 7 — Apple’s latest smartwatch. Normally $399, it’s back down to its lowest price yet at $329. We’ve seen this price a couple of times, but a $70 discount on the latest Apple product is nothing to sneeze at. This price is valid on several colorways, including Watches that include blue, green, black, red, or white bands. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><p id=\"yHqMQD\">If you have a bigger wrist or just prefer a larger display, the 45mm model isn’t much more costly.
