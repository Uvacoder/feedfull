Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/734113884613230\">a post</a> today that the company is testing NFTs on the platform, with “similar functionality” coming soon to Facebook.</p><p id=\"ZtLY9k\">Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1523655590672695296\">a video today</a> that a small group of US users will have the ability to display NFTs on their feed, stories, and in messages. NFT details are displayed in a similar way to tagged profiles and products and are named “digital collectibles.” Clicking on the tag will display details like the name of the creator and owner.</p><div id=\"xO3G4B\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NFTs on Instagram  <br><br>This week we’re beginning to test digital collectibles with a handful of US creators and collectors who will be able to share NFTs on Instagram. There will be no fees associated with posting or sharing a digital collectible on IG.<br><br>See you next week! ✌  <a href=\"https://t.co/VuJbMVSBDr\">pic.twitter.com/VuJbMVSBDr</a></p>— Adam Mosseri (@mosseri) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1523655590672695296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 9, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"lPMVjL\">Mosseri said the test is small to start so that Instagram can learn from the community. Perhaps in an attempt to tackle distrust of a major social networking platform jumping into NFTs, he brings up a tension between large companies like Instagram and the decentralized ethos of Web3. </p><p id=\"c1LOMm\">“I want to acknowledge upfront that NFTs and blockchain technologies and Web3 more broadly are all about distributing trust, distributing power,” Mosseri says. “But Instagram is fundamentally a centralized platform, so there’s a tension there.”</p><p id=\"DGzYRB\">According to <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/08/metas-instagram-to-support-nfts-from-ethereum-polygon-solana-flow/\">a report from <em>CoinDesk</em></a> over the weekend, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and Flow NFTs will be supported. </p><p id=\"6yBjnO\">Mosseri emphasizes that support for NFTs on Instagram could help introduce the technology to a broader range of people. Instagram isn’t the first platform to do so: in January, Twitter introduced NFTs on the platform as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893502/nft-twitter-profile-picture-crypto-wallet-opensea-coinbase-right-click\">hexagon-shaped profile pictures</a>. An icon in the corner of Instagram posts of NFTs also appears as a hexagon. Though companies and celebrities have been quick to jump on NFTs, and some recent sales have produced temporary activity spikes, a report by <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal </em>last week said <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/nft-sales-are-flatlining-11651552616\">sales have flatlined</a> since a peak last September.</p>",
