That’s the day before the new show <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/4/23056531/obi-wan-kenobi-second-trailer-star-wars\"><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></a> debuts on Disney Plus. In addition to the Jedi Knight himself, players can also snap up a bundle that includes a Jedi Interceptor glider and a pickaxe blade that is sadly not a lightsaber.</p><p id=\"Q4RYTq\">Of course, this is far from the crossover between <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Star Wars</em>. Just this month, Epic temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/3/23054812/fortnite-star-wars-lightsabers-may-4th-outfits-blaster-rifle-stormtroopers\">added lightsabers back into the game</a>, and prior to that, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda\">characters like the Mandalorian</a> have been notable additions to new <em>Fortnite</em> seasons. In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/14/21020296/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-fortnite-jj-abrams-lightsabers\">J.J. Abrams stopped by the virtual world</a> to show off a clip from <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>.</p><p id=\"zwUX5T\"><em>Fortnite</em> has been a busy place as of late, particularly on mobile, as the game has become accessible through both <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/5/23058642/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-free-streaming-epic-games-microsoft\">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/19/23128317/fortnite-nvidia-geforce-now-ios-android-cloud-gaming-streaming\">GeForce Now</a>.</p><p id=\"nznsbQ\"></p>",
