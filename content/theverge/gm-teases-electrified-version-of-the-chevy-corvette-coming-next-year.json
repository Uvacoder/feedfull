Stay tuned for more. <a href=\"https://t.co/6lDUWpOIZ2\">pic.twitter.com/6lDUWpOIZ2</a></p>— Chevrolet (@chevrolet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chevrolet/status/1518577631716913152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 25, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"cO09Cr\">An electric Corvette would likely cause as much excitement and controversy as Ford’s decision to release an electric Mustang. The Corvette nameplate has long been associated with impressive power and a loud exhaust. A completely silent, instantly torque-y version of the Corvette may upset some long-time fans, but GM seems confident it can still win over new customers. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"IJuN61\"><q>“This is coming very quick.”</q></aside></div><p id=\"UjMoz1\">When Reuss says that an electrified version of the ‘Vette will be out next year. It’s likely he means a hybrid, perhaps even a plug-in hybrid with a rechargeable battery. A GM spokesperson confirmed that the new Corvette released next year will “not be a full EV.” </p><p id=\"LLLJBU\">The Corvette would be the latest vehicle in the Chevy lineup to be electrified. Last year, GM announced that it would be releasing electric versions of the Chevy Equinox and Blazer SUVs. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868410/gm-chevy-equinox-blazer-ev-announced-ces\">Teaser images were released during the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show</a>, with GM noting that the Equinox will retail for a suggested price of $30,000 in an effort to drive broader adoption of electric vehicles in the US. The company also unveiled plans to release an electric Chevy Silverado pickup truck. </p><p id=\"8jb4nq\">The arrival of the Silverado, Equinox, Blazer, and Corvette EVs would put Chevy at the forefront of GM’s $35 billion push to electrify its entire lineup by 2040. In addition, the company is producing the Chevy Bolt EV and EUV, the Hummer EV pickup and SUV, the GMC Sierra EV, and the Cadillac Lyriq and Celestiq.</p><p id=\"MxBhWN\">Other Chevy vehicles are getting sidelined, though. GM said recently it would no longer provide battery replacements for the all-electric version of the Chevy Spark, which was first released in 2013. The company is working toward <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814089/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-shutdown-sales-2022\">making and replacing battery packs in over 140,000 electric Chevy Bolts</a> after a series of fires forced the automaker to halt production.</p><p id=\"KMihVV\"><em><strong>Update April 25th 9:59AM ET: </strong></em><em>Updated to include GM spokesperson statement. </em></p>",
