Timed with the Game Developers Conference this week, the company is using those funded games to showcase the range of experiences possible with its tools.</p><p id=\"3zDDtn\">There are a few parts to what Roblox is announcing on Tuesday. One is that Roblox is revealing for the first time that it’s investing $25 million as part of the Game Fund. Roblox had previously said it would be giving $500,000 minimum in each <em>Roblox</em> experience it selected for the Game Fund, but now we know how much will be given out in total.</p><p id=\"NHiYay\">Roblox has <a href=\"https://blog.roblox.com/2021/11/funding-next-generation-roblox-experiences/\">already announced</a> three games getting support from the fund — <em>Winds of Fortune</em>, <em>Rolling Thunder</em>, and <em>neonKnights</em> — and it’s sharing “first looks” of two of those experiences on Tuesday. <em>Winds of Fortune</em>, from developer Sonar Studios, looks a little bit like Microsoft’s <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, featuring ship battles, mysterious islands, and even a giant sea serpent creature. <em>Rolling Thunder</em>, from Splitting Point Studios, is a gritty first-person shooter. </p><p id=\"f0IS82\">I recommend you check out both of them in a trailer below — I was struck by<strong> </strong>how they don’t have much of the blocky <em>Roblox</em> aesthetic you may be familiar with.<strong> </strong><em>Roblox</em> tells me they’re each in pre-alpha, which means to me that parts of the game could change as development continues. If you want to try <em>Rolling Thunder</em> right now, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F7686955826%2FRolling-Thunder-PVE&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F22%2F22989995%2Froblox-game-fund-25-million-rolling-thunder-winds-of-fortune\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">it’s available for free on <em>Roblox</em></a> — though, in my five minutes of testing, I found it to be a pretty rudimentary military shooter.</p><div id=\"c46cr4\"><div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Roblox Game Fund games|106475\" data-volume-uuid=\"6808a0e3e\" data-volume-id=\"106475\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-43\" class=\"volume-video\"></div></div><p id=\"Sol3eN\">Finally, Roblox is revealing three additional games that have received support from the Game Fund: <em>Project Ruin</em>, a competitive PvE roguelike; <em>Riotfall</em>, a squad-based multiplayer FPS (that is also available to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F5595252083%2FRIOTFALL-ALPHA&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F3%2F22%2F22989995%2Froblox-game-fund-25-million-rolling-thunder-winds-of-fortune\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">try on <em>Roblox</em></a>, though it crashed every time I tried to hop into a match on my iPhone); and <em>Secret Neighbor</em>, a <em>Roblox</em>-based version of the <a href=\"https://www.secretneighbor.com/\">multiplayer game</a> that’s currently available on PC and consoles. </p><p id=\"VezCf7\">Jad Boniface, who heads up the Game Fund at Roblox, told <em>The Verge</em> in an interview that there is a larger list of games that have been greenlit, but “we’re just not ready to share details about those additional games yet.” And Roblox plans to keep <a href=\"https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/resources/game-fund\">applications for the fund</a> open through July, Boniface told me, so it seems there is still opportunity for games to get picked to receive support. As for a second fund, “we hope that the results from this Game Fund will lead to a second Game Fund, but it’s still too early to say,” Boniface said. </p><aside id=\"EH17Fx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Roblox, explained\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22457264/roblox-explainer-game-app-faq\"}]}'></div></aside>",
