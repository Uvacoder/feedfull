Tip amounts vary between $2 and $50, and fans can include a custom comment when they send creators money. The program is now open to all eligible YouTube Partner creators in 68 countries, the company announced in a blog post.</p><p id=\"gkHpqO\">YouTube has introduced a variety of ways creators can monetize interactions with fans and viewers. In addition to Super Thanks, a feature called <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14249630/youtube-super-chat-pay-pin-comments-live-stream\">Super Chat</a> allows livestream audience members to pay to have their comment pinned in the accompanying chat. With another livestream tipping feature, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20949437/youtube-live-streams-super-stickers-chat-cartoons-twitch-revenue\">Super Stickers</a>, creators can make money when fans purchase cartoon character stickers.</p><p id=\"NblPkg\">Creators make money from their videos on YouTube through ad revenue split with the platform. But some creators say that income is unreliable, especially if <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18287318/youtube-logan-paul-pewdiepie-demonetization-adpocalypse-premium-influencers-creators\">advertisers pull out</a> during controversies or bad press. The ability to monetize a fanbase directly could provide a more steady income stream for creators who worry about being too dependent on advertisers.</p>",
