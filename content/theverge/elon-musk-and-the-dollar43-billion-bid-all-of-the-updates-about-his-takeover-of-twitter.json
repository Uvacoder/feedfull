The company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011256/elon-musk-twitter-board-of-directors-ownership\">announced</a> Musk would take a seat on its board of directors, but within the space of a week, that plan unraveled, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/10/23019802/elon-musk-not-joining-twitter-board-announced\">Musk informed the board he would not accept the position</a>. </p><p id=\"N4gNY3\">After a tumultuous week, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/10/23019802/elon-musk-not-joining-twitter-board-announced\">Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced that Musk declined the board seat</a>, which released the world’s richest human from his commitment to not acquire more than 14.9 percent of the company’s shares. In a letter to Twitter employees, Agrawal said, “There will be distractions ahead, but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.” He also asked employees to “tune out the noise.”</p><p id=\"Ig8DvY\">It didn’t take long before the noise arrived <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23024905/elon-musk-offers-to-buy-twitter\">in the form of an unsolicited offer by Elon Musk to buy 100 percent of Twitter’s shares for $54.20 each</a>, or about $43 billion. The Twitter board of directors <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/15/23024978/elon-musk-twitter-buyout-offer-ownership-deal-finance\">responded by implementing a poison pill measure</a>, meant to prevent anyone (read: Elon Musk) from taking over the company simply by purchasing shares on the open market.</p><p id=\"FBVpif\">On April 25th, it was all over. Twitter <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html\">has accepted Elon Musk’s offer</a> to purchase the company for $44 billion.</p><p id=\"Vhz83Z\">Musk, who already leads Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink, is one of Twitter’s most visible users, with a large <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17505744/elon-musk-fans-tesla-spacex-fandom\">audience of devoted followers</a>. The billionaire exec spontaneously shares earthshaking company plans, uncredited memes, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20994895/elon-musk-testimony-vernon-unsworth-tweet-negligence-la-courthouse\">bizarre accusations</a>. That’s in addition to responses that serve as a global tech support line for people who want everything from help with their electric car to politicians seeking satellite internet so they can keep citizens connected during a war. </p><p id=\"7VQfd8\">The Musk era at Twitter has already included a surprise reveal that it will <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011327/twitter-edit-button-blue-test\">test an edit button for tweets</a> soon — news that the company insists had nothing to do with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011134/twitter-elon-musk-edit-button\">a poll that its almost board member posted</a> about the feature just before it was confirmed. </p><p id=\"3EVRyT\"></p>",
