Presumably, digital versions will be available, but the sole picture shared by Xseed shows limited-edition physical copies of the game that include an art book, a faux license plate, and a soundtrack CD adorned with the most obvious <em>Akira </em>reference. Xseed hasn’t yet shared a price for <em>No More Heroes 3</em> on these new platforms.</p><p id=\"Ng20p7\">Fans of the <em>No More Heroes</em> series will definitely want to play the latest installment, which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644016/no-more-heroes-3-preview-switch-release-date\">my colleague Sam Byford says</a> is a worthy follow-up to the original Nintendo Wii title. Its stylish, fluid combat is back (along with the sometimes funny, usually immature writing), and you’ll be tasked with taking on, as Sam put it, “a league of alien superheroes that makes up the posse behind a powerful CEO and a Thanos-like supervillain.” Typical Travis Touchdown stuff.</p><div id=\"bgemI0\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our favorite otaku assassin returns!

It’s very safe to assume that performance should fare better on the new port that’s coming to consoles and PC later this year. </p>",
