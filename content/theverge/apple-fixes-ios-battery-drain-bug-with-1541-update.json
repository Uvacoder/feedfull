Hopefully, though, the update will solve those — iOS 15.4 brings the really handy update of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22912677/apple-face-id-mask-update-ios-15-4-beta-hands-on-impressions\">being able to use Face ID while wearing a mask</a>, so it’d be a shame if people didn’t want to update for fear of battery issues.</p><div id=\"0wWbL3\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thanks for reaching out! We'll be happy to help. It's normal for your apps and features to need to adjust up to 48 hours after an update.<br><br>Let's have you reach out to us in a DM if this is still an issue after that time so we can help you look into this further.</p>— Apple Support (@AppleSupport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleSupport/status/1505275496837357573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 19, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"JP8nhy\">Even if your battery has been fine, it may still be worth updating reasonably soon. Apple says that <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213219\">iOS 15.4.1</a> (and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213220\">macOS Monterey 12.3.1</a>, also released today) contain security fixes for issues that Apple says could’ve been exploited in the wild. Unfortunately, this sort of warning has become pretty routine in Apple’s security bulletins — while indefinitely putting off updates has never been a great idea, it seems it’s more important than ever to make sure your devices are running the latest version of their OS.</p><p id=\"5Tisv4\">To update your iPhone, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update. To update your Mac, go to System Preferences &gt; Software Update.</p>",
