Now, we’re seeing the first signs of life: the first USB-C 2.1 cables <a href=\"https://club-3d.com/en/detail/2600/usb4_gen3x2_type_c_bi_directional_cable_8k60hz_data_40gbps_pd_240w(48v-5a)_epr_m-m_1m_-_3.28ft/\">have</a> <a href=\"https://club-3d.com/en/detail/2602/usb4_gen2x2_type_c_bi_directional_cable_4k60hz_data_20gbps_pd_240w(48v-5a)_epr_m-m_2m-6.56ft/\">broken</a> <a href=\"https://club-3d.com/en/detail/2598/usb2_type_c_bi_directional_cable_data_480mb_pd_240w(48v-5a)_epr_m-m_2m-6.56ft/\">cover</a> with up to 240W of power and up to 40Gbps of data. They’re from a Dutch manufacturer named Club3D (<a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/usb-type-c-21-cables-start-to-become-available-for-240w-power-delivery\">via <em>Tom’s Hardware</em></a>) that doesn’t sell cables on its website, and they don’t yet seem to be in stock at retailers yet either. </p><p id=\"fA6yvl\">Not that you’d necessarily want to buy one yet, of course! There aren’t any gadgets designed to use 240W of USB-C power yet, nor are there any 240W USB-C chargers, so these cables aren’t going to offer you anything new ‘til the chicken-and-egg issue gets resolved. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fWCiyXMEBfLxYmspfUyC_rl5CM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23433459/prdqAc3nMAiVcywy6Lr9Xd.jpg\">  </figure><p id=\"ebQiWo\">But that’s not the only caveat you should be aware of. As we feared last September <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702453/usb-c-pd-240-watt-charging-usb4-data-transfer-logo-branding-standard\">when the USB Implementers Forum released its USB-C 2.1 branding guidelines</a>, it looks like manufacturers are still free to mix and match which capabilities you’ll actually get from a cable. </p><p id=\"kkowtQ\">Not only does Club3D have a one-meter cable with the holy grail of 8K / 60 video, 40Gbps of data, and 240W of power, but it’s also got a two-meter cable with only half the data rate. And — get this — there’s a third two-meter cable that only carries a paltry 480Mbps of data. (That one’s stuck at USB 2.0 speeds for some reason.)</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wgfqk8qtjhRLlBM6xt8kagmJ8QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890719/New_USB_Image_for_PR_FINAL_v2__1_.jpeg\">  </figure><p id=\"BhUw5q\">Thankfully, it does look like these cables will be clearly marked to let you know which capabilities they actually carry — thank you USB-IF for the labels! Hopefully other cablemakers will follow suit. And it’s good to know that a 240W cable can stretch to at least six and a half feet long, though hopefully we’ll see even longer ones, too. While 240W may sound like a lot of watts, a typical household AC outlet can put out thousands. </p><aside id=\"J4PUm6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"USB-C is about to go from 100W to 240W, enough to power beefier laptops\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/5/25/22453936/usb-c-power-delivery-extended-power-range-epr\"},{\"title\":\"USB-C cables are getting new, confusing logos for faster 240W charging standard\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702453/usb-c-pd-240-watt-charging-usb4-data-transfer-logo-branding-standard\"}]}'></div></aside>",
