The stand lets businesses slot in an iPad so it can be used as a point-of-sale device, but the previous version needed a separate reader to accept payments from a card or phone.</p><p id=\"X3LBVd\">The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fabout%2Fsquare-stand-press-kit&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F4%2F11%2F23020499%2Fsquare-ipad-point-of-sale-stand-built-in-payments-reader\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new version</a> has its card slot and contactless payments reader right next to the display, and like the previous version of the stand (which was introduced in 2013), the device is designed to spin so that you can access those payment options when it comes time to pay. </p><p id=\"5VXnQk\">Square, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812752/square-changing-name-block-jack-dorsey-cash-app-tidal-crypto-spiral\">a subsidiary of Block</a>, also says the stand has new software. “New software for Square Stand creates a faster, more transparent checkout process that includes an order summary screen and illuminated payment icons on the face of the device to guide customer transactions and speed up purchases,” <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpress%2Fnew-square-stand&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F4%2F11%2F23020499%2Fsquare-ipad-point-of-sale-stand-built-in-payments-reader\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the company said in a press release</a>. “These additions provide sellers and shoppers with the benefits of a customer display without the need for a second screen.”</p><p id=\"LnRNlF\">The new Square Stand is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fshop%2Fhardware%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fipad-pos-stand-integrated-card-reader&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F4%2F11%2F23020499%2Fsquare-ipad-point-of-sale-stand-built-in-payments-reader\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">available to purchase now for $149</a>.
