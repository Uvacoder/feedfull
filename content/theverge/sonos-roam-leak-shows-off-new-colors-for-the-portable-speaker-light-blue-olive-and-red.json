While we wait for official confirmation on those, you can add another rumor to the list: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/uln52z/something_colourful_is_coming_the_email_says_i/\">posters on the Sonos subreddit</a> have reason to believe they’ll see new colors of the Sonos Roam speaker revealed this week, and now one of our readers points out that a  Chilean reseller may have leaked which colors are on the way.</p><p id=\"pvO95A\">Emails sent to subscribers said “something colorful” is on the way with a countdown. Any doubt about what that something may be was eliminated once posters noticed the URL in the email includes “roamcolors_teaser_owners.”</p><p id=\"WCSG2j\">As you can see from the photo above, the retail shop <a href=\"https://www.musicworld.cl/parlantes/2304-2048-parlante-portatil-btwi-fi-sonos-roam.html#/53-color_-celeste\">Music World</a> is already advertising Sonos Roam speakers in new colors. That includes olive, light blue, and red.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Sonos Roam speaker in red\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jVveJSSjSFbPC4Eu_a9CMN2kH3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23449383/parlante_portatil_btwi_fi_sonos_roam.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Music World</cite>  </figure><div id=\"hFXnJM\">    <blockquote class=\"reddit-card\" data-card-created='\"2022-05-09T16:22:56.396803+00:00\"'>      <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/uln52z/something_colourful_is_coming_the_email_says_i/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share\">Something Colourful Is Coming (the email says).

The Roam has already received a $10 price bump to $179, as Sonos adjusted pricing for its lineup last year and said it was due to supply chain issues. </p><p id=\"81P6bK\">Now that we’ve seen pictures of some additional colors, Sonos customers in other countries should find out very soon if they can grab the pocketable (and occasionally <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22956293/sonos-roam-sl-chip-shortage-portable-bluetooth-speaker\">mic-less</a>) Roam speaker in colors other than the default black and white, and for how much.</p><p id=\"suYkg8\"><em><strong>Updated 5:57PM ET:</strong></em><em> Added pictures of Sonos Roam speakers in new colors (Thanks Nicolás!)</em></p>",
