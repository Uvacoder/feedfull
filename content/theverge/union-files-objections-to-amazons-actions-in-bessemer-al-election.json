The union is asking the NLRB to schedule a hearing on its objections to determine whether the results of the second Bessemer election should be set aside and a new election held.</p><p id=\"h4UvaH\">The complaint, which you can read in full below, is about Amazon’s behavior during the union election that wrapped up last month. The final <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23004479/amazon-workers-vote-results-union-bessemer-warehouse-challenged-ballots-results\">outcome of that election is currently unknown</a> — while the votes were tallied at 993 to 875 against unionization, there were over 400 challenged ballots. As a result, the outcome depends on a hearing that hasn’t yet been scheduled. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"58gQbC\"><q>These accusations are familiar ones</q></aside></div><p id=\"cHbqV0\">The election that’s now being challenged was held as a redo, after the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1\">RWDSU lost a previous election by a nearly two to one margin last year</a>. The NLRB found that Amazon interfered with the first election in Bessemer, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22565851/amazon-bessemer-union-vote-nlrb-appeal-overturned-second-election\">ordered a new one</a>. </p><p id=\"z7lPv5\">In a statement, RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum said: “We urge the NLRB to carefully review our objections and ensure no company, not even with the bottomless pockets of Amazon, is allowed to act above the law.” </p><p id=\"YgD4g6\">Amazon did not immediately reply to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p><p id=\"iAXBYF\">Amazon has faced similar accusations before, outside of Bessemer. In January, the NLRB <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22905235/nlrb-amazon-broke-labor-laws-jfk8-warehouse-workers\">filed a complaint against Amazon</a>, saying it threatened, surveilled, and intimidated workers during the Staten Island union drive, as well as prevented organizers from distributing literature. The agency is also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22983692/nlrb-amazon-labor-activism-gerald-bryson-jfk8-warehouse-injunction\">suing the company</a> for firing Gerald Bryson, an Amazon Labor Union organizer, and is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/7/23014893/nlrb-counsel-captive-audience-meetings-union-labor-amazon\">trying to end the practice</a> of “captive audience” meetings.</p><p id=\"Qvstdm\">This means that the results of both Amazon unionization elections are currently being challenged — on Thursday, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/7/23015642/amazon-alu-union-victory-staten-island-objection-plan\">said it intended to object</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/1/23004524/amazon-workers-vote-union-jfk8-staten-island-new-york-warehouse-win\">the Amazon Labor Union’s win in New York</a>. The outcome of that election was much more decisive; workers at Amazon’s JFK8 warehouse voted to unionize, 2,654 to 2,131.</p><div id=\"RjsVrM\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21580754-rwdsu-election-objections/?embed=1&amp;responsive=1&amp;title=1\" title=\"RWDSU Election Objections (Hosted by DocumentCloud)\" width=\"700\" height=\"905\"  sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></div>",
