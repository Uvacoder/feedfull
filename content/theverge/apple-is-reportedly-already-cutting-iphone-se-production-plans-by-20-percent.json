According to <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/Apple-to-cut-iPhone-AirPods-output-amid-Ukraine-war-uncertainty\">a report from <em>Nikkei Asia</em></a>, Apple will be making 20 percent fewer iPhone SEs in the next quarter than it originally planned and 10 million fewer AirPods for all of 2022. Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1508316379656880130\">provided specific numbers</a> in his note about the demand for the SE, saying that he expects Apple to ship 15 to 20 million SEs in 2022, as opposed to his previous estimate of 25-30 million (that’s somewhere between a 22 and 66 percent decrease for the year).</p><p id=\"pTiWVb\">The reports don’t point to supply chain issues or chip shortages, which have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars\">plagued much of the electronics industry</a>, as the reason for Apple walking back its production plans. Instead, they cite lower-than-expected demand for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22975531/apple-iphone-se-2022-review-price-specs-screen-battery\">Apple’s latest budget-focused phone</a>. </p><div id=\"6PyR2k\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Shanghai lockdown doesn't affect the iPhone SE production. However, the new iPhone SE demand is lower than expected (the delivery status \"in stock\" as one of the proofs), and I cut my shipment estimation in 2022 to 15-20M (vs. 25-30M previously).</p>— 郭明錤 (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1508316379656880130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 28, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"gEgFtM\">There are plenty of factors that could lead to people being less interested in the iPhone SE. <em>Nikkei</em> cites fears over the war in Ukraine and inflation, while <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/28/apple-reduce-production-budget-iphone-se-china.html\">CNBC mentions</a> COVID lockdowns in China, making it physically harder for consumers there to get a new phone. Plus, speaking from personal experience, people who buy iPhone SEs aren’t necessarily the type to run out and upgrade the moment a new model is available. They may also be significantly less likely to do so when gas is anywhere from $4 to <a href=\"https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/average-san-diego-county-gas-price-tops-6-per-gallon/2905203/\">$6</a> a gallon. </p><p id=\"1GF07K\">The phone itself also costs more — the new generation SE costs $30 more than the last, seemingly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22968695/apple-iphone-se-price-increase-5g-tax\">thanks to 5G</a>. That narrows the cost between it and, say, an iPhone 12 or 13 Mini (and the Mini lineup is already <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22980216/apple-iphone-mini-hopefully-alive\">what the iPhone SE should be</a>). </p><p id=\"sbqbmH\">Of course, looking at retail price, the Mini is significantly more expensive, but the monthly prices are a bit of a different story. At Verizon, the SE is $11.94 a month for the 64GB model. You can get a 64GB iPhone 12 Mini for $16.66 a month or a 128GB iPhone 13 Mini for $19.44 a month. That price difference will matter to some, but there are also probably plenty of people who think, “What the heck, it’s just $5 a month extra.” And more price-conscious consumers may see the higher price and decide to stick with what they have for a few more months.</p><p id=\"L7kgUP\">All of this is to say that this doesn’t automatically mean the new SE is a flop. Still, 20 percent is a big drop in production and could help set the reference point for the SE’s sales over the phone’s (likely multi-year) lifecycle. And while it’s too early to tell what this could mean for future generations of the SE, that discussion is probably already happening within Apple — if I’m being hopeful, maybe a lukewarm reception will push the company to try a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22980216/apple-iphone-mini-hopefully-alive\">Mini</a> / <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/10/22967827/apple-iphone-se-bigger-smartphone\">Max</a> approach for the next SE.</p>",
