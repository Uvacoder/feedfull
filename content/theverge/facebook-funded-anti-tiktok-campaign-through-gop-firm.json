A Targeted Victory director told staff that the firm needed to “get the message out that while Meta is the current punching bag, TikTok is the real threat especially as a foreign owned app that is #1 in sharing data that young teens are using,” according to emails obtained by <em>The Post</em>.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"4dg6ni\"><q>“TikTok is the real threat”</q></aside></div><p id=\"EvfDak\">News of Facebook’s decision to hire the firm comes only a few weeks after the company declared that it was losing users for the first time in its 18-year history. Meta’s recent earnings report said that Facebook’s active users dropped by almost 500,000 at the end of last year. </p><p id=\"LqjYnJ\">Several of Targeted Victory’s op-eds contained links to negative news coverage about TikTok and were often bylined by influential community figures and politicians, including Democrats. <em>The Post </em>reported that none of the columns disclosed their connection to the Facebook-funded firm.</p><p id=\"UiLhLh\">Over the last few years, Facebook has been under fire by Congress for allegedly holding an illegal monopoly in the social media industry. During a 2020 hearing with tech CEOs, including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, lawmakers cited internal company documents suggesting that Zuckerberg would go <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony\">“destroy mode”</a> if Instagram, a then-nascent competitor, refused to be sold to the social media giant. </p><p id=\"yaN7RY\">“When the dominant platform threatens its potential rivals, that should not be a normal business practice,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) said at the time. </p><p id=\"FYJaCZ\">Targeted Victory is one of the biggest vendors for Republican campaigns. In 2020, the firm earned over $230 million, and its largest clients were from groups like the pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action. Republicans have been some of TikTok’s harshest critics. Lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906971/tiktok-censorship-china-bytedance-musically-marco-rubio-senate-mnuchin-cfius-treasury\">like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)</a> have pushed for the app to be investigated for censorship, and former President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21358093/trump-tik-tok-ban-bytedance-transactions-executive-order\">signed an executive order</a> to ban it outright.</p><p id=\"PMzJur\">Ultimately, the order went nowhere, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay\">President Joe Biden revoked it</a> last year. </p>",
