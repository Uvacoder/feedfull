Until this point, many routers that support the new, higher bandwidth Wi-Fi standard have been far too expensive for most budgets (think $500 to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716979/netgear-orbi-quad-band-wi-fi-6e-mesh-router-release-date-specs-price\">$1,500</a>, though there are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22991784/eero-pro6e-mesh-wifi-system-price-availability-specs\">now some in the $300 price range</a>) — but Comcast’s is $14 per month, the company’s standard fee for equipment rental.</p><p id=\"Av5AlD\">The xFi Advanced Gateway also has some smart home tricks up its sleeve. It includes built-in support for Zigbee, and Comcast has also said it will support <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer\">Matter</a>, a smart home standard <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22982166/matter-smart-home-standard-postponed-fall-2022\">slated to come out later this year</a>. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"qZtZEk\"><q>ISP-provided routers usually aren’t a great deal, but this one’s ahead of the curve</q></aside></div><p id=\"0HKv9d\">Comcast’s biggest pitch for the xFi Advanced Gateway is that it can handle traffic at faster-than-gigabit speeds (the company brands this as “Supersonic” Wi-Fi, which is a slightly silly name). Part of that is thanks to it supporting <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval\">Wi-Fi 6E</a>, which uses a third 6GHz band in addition to the traditional 2.4 and 5GHz bands. And while Wi-Fi 6 is no slouch, Comcast says that its new gateway is more powerful, which lets it process all that traffic in a reasonable amount of time. </p><p id=\"kQKQ1F\">Whether this router will provide any noticeable benefit depends on your internet speeds. If you’re on Comcast’s 200Mbps plan and never transfer files from devices inside your home over Wi-Fi, it probably won’t do a lot for you. However, people on slower plans likely wouldn’t be able to get the new Advanced Gateway anyway; it’s available through <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Flearn%2Finternet-service%2Fmodems-and-routers&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F4%2F5%2F23011707%2Fcomcast-wi-fi-6e-xfi-advanced-gateway-router\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Comcast’s xFi Gateway rental program</a>, which lets you add $14 a month to your internet bill to get a router. </p><p id=\"sBD3Vy\">With that rental plan, though, are two other models that Comcast can send you, depending on how fast your internet plan is. Those models don’t have Wi-Fi 6E or the smart home features of the new router, and you’ll still be paying $14 a month, so watch out — if you’re not on one of Comcast’s fastest plans, it’s probably a better deal to just buy your own router.</p><aside id=\"RIS6Rs\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Eero’s new Wi-Fi 6E mesh router supports over gigabit speeds and costs under $500\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22991784/eero-pro6e-mesh-wifi-system-price-availability-specs\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"9xSANt\">There are now also somewhat affordable options for people who want Wi-Fi 6E but don’t want their ISP’s router. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22991784/eero-pro6e-mesh-wifi-system-price-availability-specs\">Eero Pro 6E is $300</a> and is specced to cover a 2,000-square-foot living space. While that’s a lot of cash for a router, it’s also less than you’d pay after two years of renting Comcast’s (though, obviously, there’s a much higher up-front cost).</p><p id=\"6vqyUR\">For those that subscribe to Comcast’s $25 a month xFi Complete service (which includes a router, unlimited data, and some other perks), Comcast also has its <a href=\"https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-cybersecurity-protection-tech-upgrade-program-xfinity-internet-customers\">recently announced tech upgrade program</a>. That’ll let you get a new router every three years, so if you’ve had your current gateway for a while and want to get your hands on the new one, it may be worth reaching out to Comcast’s support to ask if you’re eligible to get the new one.</p><p id=\"iGHLsF\"><small><em>Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, </em></small><small>The Verge’s</small><small><em> parent company.</em></small></p>",
