Just last week, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/7/23014616/epic-lego-metaverse-partnership\">Epic and Lego announced a partnership to build a family-friendly take on the metaverse</a>, though with little in the way of concrete detail.

(<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1\">The metaverse concept even made a cameo at last year’s <em>Epic v. Apple</em> trial</a>.) Sony, meanwhile, previously made a big push into large virtual worlds <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22910846/sony-bungie-acquisition-playstation-destiny-halo\">when it acquired <em>Destiny</em> developer Bungie earlier this year</a>.</p><p id=\"mUXkkd\">“This investment will accelerate our work to build the metaverse and create spaces where players can have fun with friends, brands can build creative and immersive experiences, and creators can build a community and thrive,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said in a statement.</p><p id=\"YiuvRQ\">Right now, the metaverse mostly remains an idea in the mind of tech CEOs, though <em>Fortnite </em>remains arguably the closest thing we currently have to that vision through virtual events like concerts and a grab bag of pop culture tie-ins including everything from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/20/22987308/fortnite-chapter-3-season-2-battle-pass-doctor-strange\">Marvel characters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22991529/fortnite-chloe-kim-olympic-gold-medalist\">professional athletes</a> to, most recently, the late artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.</p><div id=\"kU2xRP\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Put your style on exhibit with these two new Back Blings inspired by the legendary art of Jean-Michel Basquiat.<br><br>Basquiat's Tuxedo and Crowned Rex are available on the Item Shop now. <a href=\"https://t.co/vimngooOhe\">pic.twitter.com/vimngooOhe</a></p>— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1513305835245498371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>",
