The new Anker 633 Magnetic Battery, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NRG4GK3?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">now available for $80 on Amazon</a>, has twice the capacity at 10,000mAh. That’s enough to charge an iPhone 12 twice or an iPhone 13 Pro up to 1.8 times, according to Anker (via <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/anker-magsafe-battery-gives-iphone-12-13-10-000-mah-ch-1848872520\"><em>Gizmodo</em></a>).</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQhTK06rYTV308Yv7BYriLNi3iQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23436201/Anker_MagSafe_Battery_2.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Anker</cite>      <figcaption><em>It is not small.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"GKSuVX\">As you can see, attempts at fashion have gone out the window — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744362/anker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile\">no chic colors or fancy origami stand from Anker this time</a>. Instead, this utilitarian battery pack boasts a traditional flip-out kickstand and what appears to be an extra USB-A port, in addition to Qi wireless charging. If you want faster charging than its 7.5W Qi pad offers, you can plug a USB-C cable between the USB-C port and your phone for 20W PD charging. </p><div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yhhxXX14JGk97TLhFNuEhz8NxTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23436233/magsafe_battery_3_anker.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Anker</cite>      <figcaption><em>The kickstand can hold your phone up in landscape while you charge at a faster 20W rate from the USB-C port.</em></figcaption>  </figure>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/96vJ86Rzu_vKs9deiNQyx75tgCo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23436241/51ScnQNj18L._AC_SL1500_.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Anker</cite>      <figcaption><em>Is that a USB-A port on the bottom?

Apple’s official pack <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini\">doubles as a wired passthrough 15W MagSafe charger</a>, however — something that Anker’s not-technically-MagSafe device <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory\">almost certainly won’t be able to do.</a> </p><p id=\"szUzUU\">But if you’re looking for something that’ll mostly live on a desk, both OtterBox and Anker sell <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949219/otterbox-magsafe-battery-pack-apple\">magnetic battery packs that attach to a charging stand</a> when they’re not out on the town with you.</p><p id=\"LdfoyC\">We’re not sure why Anker lists this one as the “Anker 633” on Amazon when it already has <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa25a7&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F5%2F3%2F23055917%2Fanker-633-magnetic-battery-sale-magsafe-iphone-qi-price\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an “Anker 633 Magnetic Wireless Charger”</a> that includes a smaller battery.
