The facility has around 1,600 workers in total and began its election <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23041394/amazon-labor-union-ldj5-election-organizing-trends-unionization\">last week</a>.</p><p id=\"RVjKF4\">It’s been a long road to the election at LDJ5. In October 2021, the ALU <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738310/amazon-warehouse-workers-staten-island-union-election-nlrb\">petitioned the National Labor Relations Board</a> (or NLRB) to hold an election at four Staten Island facilities, including the sorting center. However, to make sure it had a sufficient showing of interest, the union <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850880/amazon-workers-staten-island-refile-union-petition\">refiled its petition</a> to only include the JFK8 facility. In February, the ALU <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914807/amazon-workers-warehouse-nyc-petition-nlrb-union-organize\">filed a new petition</a> to hold an election for LDJ5, which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/2/22959234/amazon-union-staten-island-ldj5-election-drive-nlrb-approval-go-ahead\">was approved in March</a>. The ALU <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/1/23004524/amazon-workers-vote-union-jfk8-staten-island-new-york-warehouse-win\">pulled off a historic victory</a> the next month, when workers at the JFK8 facility voted 2,654 to 2,131 in favor of unionization.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"Ei0JU4\"><iframe title=\"Amazon's Staten Island facilities\" aria-label=\"Locator maps\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-fkmXX\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fkmXX/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"  height=\"350\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div></div><p id=\"ZuG7TW\">The fight to unionize LDJ5 will likely not end here. At another Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union successfully lobbied the NLRB (which oversees the votes) to hold another election, alleging that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer\">Amazon had interfered</a>. While the votes tallied in the redo signaled a loss for the union, a high number of contested ballots <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23004479/amazon-workers-vote-results-union-bessemer-warehouse-challenged-ballots-results\">means that nothing is final yet</a>. The RWDSU has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/7/23015822/union-objections-amazon-bessemer-alabama-election-redo\">already submitted a complaint</a> accusing Amazon of interfering in the second Bessemer vote.</p><p id=\"c4oFMf\">After the count finished, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amazonlabor/status/1521197310708961286?s=20&amp;t=LEBglcW_KA5owZlRjGJOHA\">the ALU tweeted</a> that it will continue organizing “at this facility and beyond.” It does still have to negotiate a contract with Amazon for the workers at JFK8, as long as the results of the election aren’t reversed (Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/8/23017252/amazon-alu-union-eleciton-objections-filing\">submitted a complaint</a> that the union and NLRB “suppressed and influenced votes” at the facility). That process could take months and will likely require support from the facility’s workforce.</p><p id=\"ddfNTK\">The ALU “will certainly contest the election,” according to a statement from the group’s lawyer <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vy8n/amazon-labor-union-loses-vote-next-door-to-their-first-victory\">given to <em>Vice</em></a>. He continued to say that Amazon “violated laboratory conditions in this election with mandatory anti-union meetings,” a practice that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/7/23014893/nlrb-counsel-captive-audience-meetings-union-labor-amazon\">the NLRB has been seeking to end</a>.</p>",
