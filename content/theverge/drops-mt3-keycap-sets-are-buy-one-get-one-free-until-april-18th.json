Drop is once again here with another <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fall-communities%2Fdrops%2FMT3BOGO&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F4%2F12%2F23017178%2Fmechanical-keyboards-drop-mt3-matt3o-keycaps-bogo-google-chromecast-apple-mac-mini-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">buy one, get one free deal on base or ortholinear kits of its exclusive MT3 keycaps</a>. This is the return of a deal we saw in February, though there has been a restock of select colorways that quickly sold out of stock last time around, like the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fbuy%2Fdrop-mito-mt3-cyber-custom-keycap-set&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F4%2F12%2F23017178%2Fmechanical-keyboards-drop-mt3-matt3o-keycaps-bogo-google-chromecast-apple-mac-mini-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cyber</a> set by designer MiTo. Most keycap sets run $110 to $120 for a base kit that includes your essential keys for most boards. Add two sets to your cart and use the code <strong>MT3BOGORETURNS</strong> at checkout, and the second set of equal or lesser value becomes free.</p><p id=\"sJD7zj\">These sculpted keycaps are designed to fit Cherry-style switches, and they have a more unique look than your average caps. The scooped design is by Matt3o, and it’s exclusive to Drop. Combine that with all the colorways that Drop is offering, including the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fbuy%2Fdrop-mt3-dasher-keycap-set%3FdefaultSelectionIds%3D967013&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F4%2F12%2F23017178%2Fmechanical-keyboards-drop-mt3-matt3o-keycaps-bogo-google-chromecast-apple-mac-mini-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dasher</a> set for you <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23013413/severance-apple-tv-plus-production-design-computers\"><em>Severance</em> fans</a> or some of the Marvel-themed offerings if you’re big on the MCU, and you can really accentuate your desk with something cool. Just keep in mind that these tend to sell out quickly when these promos are running, so don’t waste any time in your search for that extra colorful punch for your “thocky” setup.</p><div id=\"FexEWQ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11057440\"></div></div><p id=\"mqyR32\">If you’re in need of a computer to go with your keyboard (I know it’s usually the other way around but just bear with me), Apple’s M1-powered Mac Mini has fallen to a new all-time low price at Amazon. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5PHB83/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The tiny desktop computer is now $569.99</a> in its base form with 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and that versatile Apple M1 CPU. The discounted price, saving you about $130 off MSRP, is reflected at checkout. </p><p id=\"f8lCtI\">The current Mac Mini has been with us since late 2020, and while the pricey new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22981815/apple-mac-studio-m1-ultra-max-review\">Mac Studio</a> is all the rage recently, this affordable computer is versatile enough for everyday use and even some light creative work. Just keep in mind that you need a monitor, mouse, and keyboard to go along with it. If you have those peripherals already, then you’re good as gold. Now do yourself a favor and get a set of speakers or headphones because the Mini’s built-in speakers are pretty bad. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"f8HWEn\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9712859\"></div></div><p id=\"xlvZwf\">Traditionally, fall is when all the biggest TV shows come around, but it’s spring right now and, between Marvel’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22999812/moon-knight-review\"><em>Moon Knight</em></a>, <em>Our Flag Means Death</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23015650/severance-season-1-review-apple-tv-plus\"><em>Severance</em></a>, there are some impeccable new and recent shows to stream. It’s perfect timing, then, for the Chromecast with Google TV to once again go on sale for $39.99 at <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg02lHFjUcb\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FChromecast-with-Google-TV%2F403830906&amp;subid1=vergedailydeals041222\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>. </p><p id=\"8FToUf\">This $10 discount comes and goes on Google’s popular streamer, which remains <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">our top pick for streamers for most people</a> — especially if you don’t want to spend too much but still want niceties like 4K resolution, Dolby Vision HDR, and a plethora of app support. One of this Chromecast’s best assets over previous models is the included remote. You can still directly cast content to your heart’s content using Google Cast and apps like YouTube. But having a remote control at the ready is so handy, it’s part of what makes this the best Chromecast to date. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"dAbxyZ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11018142\"></div></div><p id=\"TeSgxu\">The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg02kFqsdN1\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Beats Fit Pro, one of our collective favorite pairs of earbuds right now, is marked down to $99.99</a> in refurbished condition at Best Buy. The thought of putting earbuds in your ears that were once used by someone else may sound a little gross, but this is an impressive savings on these excellent buds. </p><p id=\"zJvGp8\">The Beats Fit Pro are some of the best sounding noise-canceling earbuds around with a good transparency mode and a design that stays in your ears while you move around or exercise. Normally, these earbuds run $199.99, but this refurbished deal has them at half-price in black or white colorways — the lowest price we’ve seen yet. And hey, you can always <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22759139/earbuds-wireless-airpods-clean-how-to\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">clean them yourself</a> or return them within 15 days if you change your mind. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"sV1tUH\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11140274\"></div></div><p id=\"eWktmp\">We’ve covered deals on a small streaming device, a tiny desktop computer, and keycaps for keyboards of all sizes — so here’s a deal on a laptop with a big ol’ screen. The LG Gram 17 sports a 17-inch screen in a lightweight chassis, and right now, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G3LDYKV?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">it’s just $1,396.99 on Amazon</a>. This configuration boasts an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a 2560 x 1600 resolution IPS panel. Its display has a 16:10 aspect ratio for a little extra vertical working space than many other laptops offer, but it still weighs in at under three pounds. For comparison’s sake, the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro is about 4.7 pounds. There’s a reason it earned itself a spot in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">our list of best laptops for 2022</a>.</p><p id=\"qvYzmu\">While we see frequent deals on the LG Gram, this is one of the lowest to date, dropping the price by $453 off MSRP. If you love a big laptop but don’t want to tote around a boat anchor, so to speak, the Gram is a great choice. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"mTQ2jm\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10498451\"></div></div><h2 id=\"TVFxwr\">Clickity-clackity, time for more <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2BEvh6HSQc0\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">diddly-doodly</a> deals:</h2><ul><li id=\"AEDa9y\">Best Buy has <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cg02IjHqnZp\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Halo Infinite</em> on Xbox for just $19.99</a> ($40 off) along with a free steelbook case and a voucher for an in-game multiplayer weapon skin. This game is included with Game Pass, but this is a great value for any non-subscribers who want to play the campaign or be ready for its eventual co-op update. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</li><li id=\"3WdEtl\">The massive <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09D78KLK1?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zendure Super Tank Pro portable power bank with 26,800mAh and 100W PD charge output is currently $179.99</a> at Amazon when you click the on-page coupon to save $50. It’s powerful enough to charge some laptops, and it shows output levels on its OLED screen. Even with all of that power, it’s compact enough to fit into a small bag or luggage. </li><li id=\"Vv9hdt\">Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">third-gen AirPods are back down to $149.99</a> (about $29 off) at Amazon, just $10 shy of their all-time low price. They may not have noise cancellation, but the MagSafe-compatible wireless charging case is a handy upgrade over the prior generation that came standard with a wired case — and they sound better, too. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</li><li id=\"lLhjOQ\">If you prefer to buy your phones unlocked or without messy payment plans through carriers, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HYR2NC8?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon has the Pixel 6 Pro for $868.61</a> (about $30 off) in black with the base 128GB storage. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</li></ul><aside id=\"Vw2nFm\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
