According to <a href=\"https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status\">Xbox’s status page</a>, the outage started around 4PM ET, and the company is currently working on a fix.</p><p id=\"WmtfB7\">“We’re aware that some users are unable to purchase &amp; launch games or start Cloud Gaming sessions,” Xbox Support <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XboxSupport/status/1523029660656828417\">said in a tweet</a>. “Our teams are investigating.

Some players were unable to start Cloud Gaming sessions, launch digital games, make purchases, or even access streaming apps including Netflix and Disney Plus.</p><p id=\"M6BLLg\">Although Xbox <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XboxSupport/status/1522836465503326208\">seemed to resolve these problems</a>, it looks like issues with its store, digital titles, and Cloud Gaming have started to resurface. As my colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1523045294677831680\">Tom Warren notes</a>, if you’re affected by the outage, you should still be able to <a href=\"https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/connect-network/using-xbox-one-offline\">play games offline</a> when you have your Xbox set <a href=\"https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/my-home-xbox\">as your “home” console</a>. Xbox Support <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XboxSupport/status/1523053566931312640\">also says</a> rebooting your Xbox console might help.</p><p id=\"j9pIqS\"><em><strong>Update, May 7th 5:45PM ET: </strong></em><em>Updated to add that rebooting your Xbox console may help resolve some issues.</em></p>",
