The renders of the Galaxy Z Fold 4 show a similar overall design to its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review\">Z Fold 3,</a> with a 6.2-inch cover display and a 7.6-inch folding inner display, but with a redesigned rear camera configuration inspired by this year’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22941246/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-review-price-screen-specs-stylus\">Galaxy S22 Ultra</a>.</p><p id=\"iFdB0W\">This inner display will reportedly once again have an under-display selfie camera, a feature that disappointed us on last year’s device. This year’s version has reportedly seen performance improvements, which are sorely needed. Around back there are three rear cameras, same as last year, but <em>SmartPrix </em>doesn’t offer any details on what their specs could be. </p><div id=\"JIYaIP\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So... Here comes your very first look at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Samsung?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Samsung</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyZFold4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GalaxyZFold4</a>!

The Z Fold 3 offered S-Pen support, but there was no built-in slot to store it — instead customers had to buy a phone case to house it. <em>The Elec</em>’s report also claims that the Z Fold 4’s screen dimensions would be slightly different from last year, with an inner screen that’s a fraction of an inch larger, and an outer display a fraction of an inch smaller.</p><p id=\"WL8Cx9\">There’s no official word on when we might see the Z Fold 4 announced, but <em>SmartPrix</em> reports we could see an announcement in August or September. For reference, last year’s Z Fold 3 was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on\">launched in early August</a>.</p><p id=\"pOoewn\"></p><p id=\"iTv6Cx\"></p>",
