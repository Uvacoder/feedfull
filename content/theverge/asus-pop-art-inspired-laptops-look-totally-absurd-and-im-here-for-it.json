Asus has collaborated with two pop artists, Philip Colbert of London and Steven Harrington of Los Angeles, to create this line. Per the company, the models “represent the unique world-view of the artist, with specially commissioned themed accessories and packaging featuring their original artwork.”</p><p id=\"qfKNi7\">Basically, these are convertible laptops covered in bespoke art. I’m sure this isn’t actually what happened, but I like to imagine that Asus just gave each of these dudes a Vivobook 13 Slate and a box of crayons and just let them go to town.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"The Asus Vivobook Slate 13 OLED Philip Colbert Edition seen from the back on a white background.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uwz-pM2w8bl6dd0Fpie7QVVXjFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23440565/Vivobook_13_Slate_OLED_Philip_Colbert_Edition_PR_photo_Cover_Stand_with_switchable_cargo_nets.png\">      <cite>Image: Asus</cite>      <figcaption><em>Yes, those are eggs.</em></figcaption>  </figure>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"The Asus Vivobook 13 Slate OLED open on a white background with the keyboard attached.

This is just a thing Asus likes to do. The company has collaborated with all kinds of eclectic artists in the past to put out laptops that look patently ridiculous and that I also love with all my heart. While you’re here, make sure to check out the one they did with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22629096/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-alan-walker-edition-dj-deck-gaming-laptop\">Norwegian DJ Alan Walker</a>, which literally shipped with a cardboard DJ deck, or their collaboration with Acronym, which... well, I’m not even going to try to describe it. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21432977/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-acronym-amd-ryzen-9-4900hs-nvidia-rtx-2060\">You should just look</a>. </p><p id=\"cIK3Bm\">I have no idea who buys any of these things; in general, the best answer to the question “why is Asus making this very silly thing?” is a shrug emoji. These are glorious devices. Don’t think about it too hard.</p><p id=\"4mwN7A\">Starting with the Philip Colbert Edition: it’s covered in Colbert’s original artwork, which in this case, appears to be a lot of eggs and lobsters. Asus refers to the back case as “the special fried-egg-themed cover stand” multiple times in its promotional materials. The device also comes with — and I am not making this up, this is lifted directly from the press release — “a sculpted cartoon lobster figurine that doubles up as a funky stylus holder for the bundled Asus Pen 2.0.” Welp, I’m sold.</p><p id=\"hsqvpb\">The Steven Harrington Edition is, I think, a bit over my head. I’m spotting a number of objects in this incredibly chaotic design, including palm trees with teeth, a dog wearing a bowtie, and a disembodied eyeball that is also on fire. No lobsters to be seen, but some of these palm trees do look a bit hungry. (The dog, named Mello, is a recurring character of Harrington’s.)</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"The Asus Vivobook 13 Slate OLED Steven Harrington Edition with its parts laid out on a flat white surface.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8QOdjcXD_Ig38X8ygnjilYdW8_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23440532/Vivobook_13_Slate_OLED_Steven_Harrington_Edition_PR_photo_Total_package.png\">      <cite>Image: Asus</cite>      <figcaption><em>As I was saying...</em></figcaption>  </figure>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"The Asus Vivobook Slate 13 OLED Steven Harrington Edition closed on a white background.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJs9ldA4je0Mdhp1qsIXFEf-fYc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23440577/Vivobook_13_Slate_OLED_Steven_Harrington_Edition_PR_photo_Sleeve.png\">      <cite>Image: Asus</cite>      <figcaption><em>Don’t worry, you won’t forget the brand.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"8zxmVZ\">Now, in terms of the other laptop stuff, the Vivobook 13 Slate OLED is more underwhelming. It’s a 2-in-1 OLED Windows laptop with a detachable keyboard, which is neat. The bad news is that it only comes with an Intel Pentium Silver N6000 processor, which is not a good chip by any definition. RAM can also only go up to 8GB and storage maxes out at 256GB. This is going to be slow: if you’re buying it, you should assume it’s going to be a miniature TV to watch things on and that’s about it.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"A lobster figurine holding an Asus stylus on a white background.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9MoNng7pzsPuC6dKAkWeuXQeFaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23440507/Vivobook_13_Slate_OLED_Philip_Colbert_Edition_PR_photo___Stylus_Holder.png\">      <cite>Image: Asus</cite>      <figcaption><em>Wasn’t kidding about the lobster thing.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"4wH3ot\">Of course, that may be a viable use case for some folks who are shopping in the egg-and-lobster-laptop category, and more power to all of them. I can certainly think of plenty of coffee shops and bars where a device like this would fit right in. And, in a laptop market full of boring grays and blacks, there’s no question that a splash of unique flavor is always welcome. </p><p id=\"5FLlRx\">Asus hasn’t provided the prices of these devices yet, but a regular <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FASUS-VivoBook-13-Slate-OLED-T3300KA-DH21T-2-in-1%2F8s72v9hvrkbx%3Fcrosssellid%3D%26selectedColor%3D\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vivobook 13 Slate</a> is currently listed at $599.99. The devices are expected in late Q2.</p>",
