You can get $70 off <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fzendure%2Dsupertank%2Dpro%2D26%2D800mah%2Dpower%2Dbank%2Dwith%2D4%2Dusb%2Dc%2Doled%2Dscreen%2Dupgradable%2D100w%2Dpd%2Dsilver&amp;afftrack=vergenewsletter051122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zendure’s SuperTank Pro at Wellbots</a>, which has a 26,800mAh capacity, up to 100W charging, and four USB-C ports. Normally $229.99, it costs just $159.99 with the offer code <strong>ZENVERGE </strong>used at checkout.</p><p id=\"v0uRei\">This battery pack may be overkill to some in terms of heft and price, but it could be the ideal travel charger for people who like to bring multiple devices on trips. Compared to its predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18410552/laptop-portable-batteries-high-wattage-usb-c-charger\">which I put to the test here</a>, the latest version brings several improvements.   Notably, it can deliver its maximum 100W throughput while getting the maximum charging speeds with the other three ports. Also, its OLED display provides more info about how quickly your devices are charging.</p><p id=\"eVDgr3\">Here are some interesting tidbits <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21409482/zendure-supertank-pro-charger-review\">from our review</a>: “The SuperTank Pro can put out enough wattage to power two 13-inch MacBook Pros while out and about <em>and</em> top off two smartphones at the same time. It can provide enough power to keep a phone going on its own for a week on the road.” </p><div id=\"IebIHb\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11186575\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ksLtk_barDDCR3tLE9wCxKFXT3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8070173/jbareham_1492_170228_0126.0.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by James Bareham / The Verge</cite>  </figure><p id=\"sXwleg\">At Amazon and Walmart, you can save $40 off the price of a new Nintendo Switch. This is the biggest discount we’ve seen at retailers, beating the usual $20 off that we tend to see regularly at Woot. For those who aren’t in the know, the Switch is so dang great, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22958526/nintendo-switch-five-year-anniversary-console-gaming\">even after five years of being available</a> on store shelves.</p><p id=\"1bv53C\">This deal gets you the standard, non-OLED Switch that includes two Joy-Con controllers and a dock that enables you to use the console with your television. This means that it’s also compatible with some must-have accessories, like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Human-Things-compatible-Nintendo-Portable/dp/B08BRHGFCK?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Genki’s Covert Dock</a>, which does the same work as Nintendo’s dock but in a more travel-friendly shape and size. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild\"><strong>Read our review of the Switch</strong></a> (but keep in mind that it was written before Nintendo released wave after wave of great games for the console).</p><div id=\"2lR4vT\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10988261\"></div></div><p id=\"itBqgz\">While we’re on the topic of the Nintendo Switch, a great game to grab for that system at a deal is <em>Pokémon Legends Arceus</em>. This is the latest mainline <em>Pokémon</em> title, and it’s available for $49.94 at <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPokemon-Legends-Arceus-Nintendo-Switch%2F890161998&amp;subid1=vergenewsletter051122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0914YGQSH/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>. This game (at least, until today) had maintained its regular $59.99 asking price, so it may be a good time to check it out if you’ve been waiting.</p><p id=\"GSZMDP\"><em>Pokémon Legends Arceus</em> breathes new life into the game’s formula, with more exciting gameplay, new features, and a brand-new locale. For new and returning <em>Pokémon </em>fans alike, this game should deliver a good time. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"7Lk2ne\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11004970\"></div></div><h2 id=\"fa7QNa\">More deals for the hump day</h2><ul><li id=\"4WqZu9\">The physical edition of the <em>Resident Evil 2</em> remake has hit rock-bottom prices at Best Buy. <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/chdDMCdzpIk\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">You can get the Xbox version for $9.49</a>, while the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/chdDOB800z9\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PlayStation 4 version costs $10.99</a>.
