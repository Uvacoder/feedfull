The FDA said in a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-second-booster-dose-two-covid-19-vaccines-older-and\">statement</a> that an additional dose could bolster any waning protection from the vaccines in these groups. </p><p id=\"pBUi8s\">Once again, the FDA is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22633116/covid-data-us-vaccine-boosters\">leaning on data from other countries</a> as the foundation for its decision-making around COVID-19 vaccines — in this case, data from Israel, which found a lower rate of serious illness and death in older adults who had two boosters compared with just one. But research showed while a fourth shot boosted antibody levels for younger people, it didn’t offer much protection against infection <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2202542\">with the virus</a>.</p><p id=\"Hbs4Ip\">The US is already struggling to get first booster doses in arms: over half of fully vaccinated people <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total\">haven’t received one</a>, and a third of people over 65 have not been boosted. </p><p id=\"iAJMjy\"> </p><p id=\"ftbqkL\"></p>",
