This is a high-performing gaming mouse that can appeal to even non-gamers, thanks to its no-frills looks. The average person could be hard-pressed to tell that this mouse is rated for esports-level performance if they just saw it sitting on a desk at the office. Aside from discreet looks, its strengths lie in its lightweight build — weighing only around 63 grams. On the software side, you have to deal with the gaming-focused Logitech G Hub app, but it allows you to customize the two extra buttons and tweak the DPI sensitivity of its Hero sensor to your heart’s content. Tune it to your liking and zip around your shooter game of choice for some 360-no-scope joy. Or, you know, some really long spreadsheets.</p><div id=\"x7Cou7\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11224773\"></div></div><p id=\"S7996M\">Apple’s AirPods from late-2021 have once again inched closer to their best price.

It’s what a lot of brands spout when trying to make a lifestyle product sound <em>tough</em> and <em>cool</em>. The Garmin Instinct Tactical fitness tracker has some specs to prove it, meeting military standard 810G for thermal, shock, and water resistance — meaning it’s designed to take a lot of punishment. It also has some features that are specifically catered toward military personnel — like a night mode for use with actual night vision goggles. This is the kind of smartwatch for someone who values the expansive GPS tracking, which should cover even the most remote areas, and appreciates an aesthetic that’s reminiscent of G-Shocks.</p><p id=\"Y6jOsT\">Garmin’s Instinct Tactical is currently available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VPDK7VQ?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fgp0100206470.html&amp;sharedid=vergedailydeals051822\">Adorama</a> for $199.99 — a $100 off its regular price of $299.99.
