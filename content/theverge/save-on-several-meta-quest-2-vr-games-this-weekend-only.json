We’ve got <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/20/23030460/meta-quest-game-vr-showcase-biggest-announcements\">a roundup of the titles that we’re most excited about right here</a>. In celebration of the event, Meta has slashed prices on several VR games that see discounts only on a few occasions each year. So, whether you just bought a Quest 2, or you just want to fill out your library a little more, <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=43993&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2Fsection%2F672095367440067%2F%23%2F%3F_k%3Dllpqi5\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check out these deals</a>.</p><p id=\"D90WqL\">I’ve highlighted a few deals that I think are particularly good:</p><ul><li id=\"TEhgh0\"><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=43993&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2897337400373711\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners</em></a> is $31.99 (usually $39.99)</li><li id=\"i9YgW8\"><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=43993&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2582932495064035\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Real VR Fishing</em></a> is $14.99 (usually $19.99)</li><li id=\"Y6IpNS\"><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=43993&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2124523024270629\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Room VR: A Dark Matter</em></a> is $23.99 (usually $29.99)</li><li id=\"E4WRsE\"><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;mid=43993&amp;u1=verge&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2334376869949242\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>In Death: Unchained</em></a> is $23.99 (also usually $29.99)</li></ul>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y53nZZLH59Xl8UsLsNFj5wefzeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21935903/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-1.0.jpeg\">      <cite>Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge</cite>  </figure><p id=\"rpcEtB\">In case you’re in the market for a compact, yet capable smart speaker, Google’s Nest Audio may fit the bill. Normally $99.99, this model is price-reduced at Google’s Store, as well as at Best Buy and Walmart to $79.99.</p><p id=\"VXmOnH\">As someone who got a little tired of reserving counter space for a giant Google Home Max, the upgrade (or, downgrade, technically) to the smaller Nest Audio was a smart move for me. It provides crisp sound that can get loud without degradation to its low or high-end delivery, so I’m not missing that more powerful speaker as much as I thought I would. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features\"><strong>Read our full review of the Nest Audio by Dan Seifert.</strong></a></p><div id=\"2rNH9R\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10872990\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"Logitech StreamCam\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nh1GFyxuwOqYABKQWVCaktQzGYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820366/akrales_210831_4734_0060.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>A close-up photo of Logitech’s StreamCam webcam, which can shoot in 1080p resolution at up to 60 frames per second.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"1p1rxP\">Best Buy is hosting a slew of Earth Day promotions that aim to get you into one of its stores, with your old computer accessories in tow. And there’s good reason to if you have the chance this weekend, as the retailer will give you one 20 percent off coupon toward a new Logitech accessory, like its excellent Logitech StreamCam, or the G435 wireless gaming headset, when you hand over an old PC or gaming accessory. This in-store offer ends on May 6th. <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech%2Fearth-day%2Fpcmcat1649080616911.c&amp;sharedid=theverge.com\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">You can read the details here</a>.</p><p id=\"OZYPhg\">Also at Best Buy, you can trade in your old modem, router, or modem/router combo to receive a 15 percent discount on a new model. This is another in-store-only offer, and unfortunately, Google’s networking products are excluded from the deal. Though, it should help you get a great price on a product from other recommended brands in the space, like Eero, Orbi, and others. <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Frecycling%2Fnetworking-recycling-offer%2Fpcmcat1497300657381.c&amp;sharedid=theverge.com\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Details are here.</a></p><p id=\"avuIg9\">Lastly for Best Buy’s in-store Earth Day promos, you can take any hard drive or SSD to the retailer for recycling and receive a coupon that’ll knock 10 percent off the cost of a Western Digital or SanDisk Professional hard drive. Note that these are high-capacity disk drives, and not speedy SSDs. Still, it could be worth it if you need some extra storage for big files. <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Frecycling%2Fstorage-recycling-offer%2Fpcmcat1628281022996.c&amp;sharedid=theverge.com\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Here are the details,</a> and <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fwd-recycle-offer&amp;sharedid=theverge.com\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here are the eligible models</a> that can be discounted.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D8wYD0e3YbDDMOim39ZxpgojNzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902334/dseifert_4748_nest_doorbell_cam_battery_4.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The Nest Doorbell next to the Ring Video Doorbell.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"nraryu\">Google Nest’s battery-powered Doorbell is seeing a major discount, and it’s happening at Amazon and other retailers. Normally $179.99 for this slender model, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-Doorbell-Battery-Wireless/dp/B09K6XXJXX/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you can pick one up for $149.99 in various colors</a>. This might be a great product for first-time smart doorbell owners. To that end, my colleague Dan Seifert praised its great people and package-detecting capabilities, as well as its longer-than-average battery life. </p><p id=\"cTmtAZ\">Though, this battery-powered option leaves a few features on the table compared to prior generations. Namely, it shoots at a lower resolution, and it lacks 24/7 continuous recording. Still, this deal lessens the sting of those flaws. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features\"><strong>Read our full review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"deEcF6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10873038\"></div></div><aside id=\"6WAkl6\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside><p id=\"Bgt0lf\"></p>",
