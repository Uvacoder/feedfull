While we wait for official confirmation on those, you can add another rumor to the list: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/uln52z/something_colourful_is_coming_the_email_says_i/\">posters on the Sonos subreddit</a> have reason to believe they’ll see new colors of the Sonos Roam speaker revealed this week.</p><p id=\"pvO95A\">Emails sent to subscribers said “something colorful” is on the way with a countdown. Any doubt about what that something may be was eliminated once posters noticed the URL in the email includes “roamcolors_teaser_owners.”</p><div id=\"hFXnJM\">    <blockquote class=\"reddit-card\" data-card-created='\"2022-05-09T16:22:56.396803+00:00\"'>      <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/uln52z/something_colourful_is_coming_the_email_says_i/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share\">Something Colourful Is Coming (the email says).
