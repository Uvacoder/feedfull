However, it still seems the movie might be a long way from actually hitting theaters, though, as neither <em>THR</em> or <em>Variety</em> provided a projected release date. Warner Bros. didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><p id=\"G4V2su\">The <em>Minecraft</em> movie has hit a few blocks (buh-dum tish) over the past several years. The movie was first announced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/27/5454784/a-minecraft-movie-may-be-coming-to-a-theater-near-you\">in 2014</a>, and months later, <em>Night at the Museum</em> and <em>Free Guy</em> director Shawn Levy <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/16/6990969/shawn-levy-may-direct-minecraft\">was reportedly set to direct</a>. But in 2015, Rob McElhenney, known for his work on <em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia </em>and Apple TV Plus’ hit show <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738881/mythic-quest-renewed-season-three-four-apple-tv-plus\"><em>Mythic Quest</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/21/9011309/minecraft-movie-rob-mcelhenney-its-always-sunny-director\">was confirmed as the director</a>, and in 2016, the movie was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/27/12043180/minecraft-movie-release-date\">given a 2019 release date</a>. McElhenney later left the project <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/5/17652962/minecraft-movie-delayed-rob-mcelhenney-departed-aaron-adam-nee-microsoft\">in 2018</a>, and Warner Bros. delayed the film. At one point, the <em>Minecraft</em> movie was set to release on March 4th, 2022, but it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503618/the-batman-matrix-4-release-dates-warner-bros\">got pushed</a> to make room for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22954478/the-batman-review-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves-movie\"><em>The Batman</em></a>. </p><p id=\"9A1Yew\">Despite the issues, a <em>Minecraft</em> movie still seems like it could be a good bet for Warner Bros. The <em>Minecraft</em> franchise is still very popular, having just <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838148/minecraft-1-trillion-views-youtube-mojang-microsoft\">surpassed 1 trillion views (yes, with a T) on YouTube in December</a>. And video game movies are having a bit of a moment, with the <a href=\"https://www.thegamer.com/uncharted-movie-over-300-million-global-box-office/\"><em>Uncharted</em> movie</a> (which had <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/uncharted-movie-development-hell-a-timeline-of-all/2900-3354/#1\">its own share of development difficulties</a>) and <a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/film/box-office/box-office-sonic-2-opening-weeked-michael-bay-ambulance-1235229294/\"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em></a> so far proving to be big hits. We’ll have to wait and see if the <em>Minecraft</em> film and the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690607/chris-pratt-mario-nintendo-illumination-animated-movie-december-2022-release-date-cast\">Chris Pratt-led <em>Mario</em> movie</a> will keep up the trend.</p><p id=\"ZkLpf6\"><em><strong>Update April 18th, 7:51PM ET</strong></em><em>: </em>The Ankler<em> also reported on the negotiations.</em></p>",
