North America is not on that list, but Motorola says the region will get another (unspecified) Edge family device later in the year.</p><p id=\"EXKP9B\">The Motorola Edge 30 offers a smaller screen and thinner build than the Edge 30 Pro — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22992862/motorola-edge-plus-2022-review-price-specs-screen-battery\">also known as the Edge Plus</a> in North America. Its 6.5-inch 1080p OLED supports a fast 144Hz refresh rate, like the 30 Pro, but uses a Snapdragon 778 chipset that’s a step down from the 8 Gen 1 processor in the flagship. Rear cameras appear to be the same configuration of a stabilized 50-megapixel f/1.8 wide, 50-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. There’s a lower-res 32-megapixel selfie camera (compared to the 60-megapixel unit on the 30 Pro), and rear camera video recording tops out at 4K rather than 8K.</p><div id=\"PbkNaH\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:11164465\"></div></div><p id=\"VwrT3W\">The Edge Plus’ / Edge 30 Pro’s higher price tag of $999 in the US and €799 in Europe pits it against some very capable competitors <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22955139/samsung-galaxy-s22-plus-review\">like the Samsung Galaxy S22 Plus</a>, and it doesn’t really keep up. Swapping in a less expensive processor and paring back a few features here and there makes it a more tempting proposition with midrange pricing. But in the US, the midrange competition is steep, too, dominated by — you guessed it — Samsung. If a version of the Edge 30 comes to the US, the price will have to be right to compete with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23015400/samsung-galaxy-a53-5g-review-specs-price-screen-camera\">the very good (and, at $449, well-priced) Galaxy A53 5G</a>.</p>",
