Its release comes ahead of Google’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981868/google-i-o-2022-may-11th-12th-online-virtual\">annual developer conference next month</a> when the company is expected to fully detail its plans for the update — due for release later this year.</p><p id=\"3qp900\">For end users, the most interesting features are those that have already appeared in Android 13’s initial two developer previews. There’s support for Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio, a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/10/22926874/android-13-features-developer-previewlanguage-controls\">new photo picker</a> that lets you restrict which of your photos an app is able to access, new app icon theming options, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22981999/google-android-13-notification-opt-in-default-developer-preview\">a new permission</a> that could cut down on notification spam. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cmMl6vEoTbUHliaEvatMBXk-fFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23416683/Untitled_5.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Google</cite>      <figcaption><em>Apps will need to ask for permission to access specific filetypes.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"9MhRr8\">In contrast, the new features for this public beta are much more developer-focused, like changes to the app permission for accessing shared media files in local storage. In a blog post, Google VP of engineering Dave Burke says the permission will now be specific to the type of media an app needs to access — images, video, or audio — rather than simply asking for permission to access all files. </p><p id=\"tu4Pr1\">Keystore and KeyMint, the parts of Android that can handle cryptographic keys, have been updated to provide more informative error codes. There are also new APIs for audio playback. </p><p id=\"CpN73c\">For more information on how to sign up for and download the beta, check out Google’s <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13\">Android 13 developer site</a>. Anyone already running the developer preview should automatically receive the new beta.</p>",
