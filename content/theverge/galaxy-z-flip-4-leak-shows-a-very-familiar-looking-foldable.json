But while the next Fold might get a redesigned camera bump, the Z Flip 4’s design looks almost identical to its predecessor. Externally it still has a two-tone color scheme with a pair of cameras and small notification display, while inside there’s still a 6.7-inch foldable display with a hole-punch selfie cutout in the top middle.</p><p id=\"4UZD4v\">That’s not necessarily much of a surprise, nor is it definitely a bad thing. Samsung followed up its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price\">first Z Flip</a> with the almost-identical <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333566/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5g-announced-price-release-date-1449-99\">Z Flip 5G</a> just months later, so it’s already proved it’s happy to update the internals of its foldables without changing their external appearance. And since we were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review\">pretty impressed by last year’s Z Flip 3</a> (“the first folding phone for normal people”) an immediate design overhaul doesn’t feel essential, even if we wouldn’t say no to a slightly larger external display.</p><div id=\"7xZ3XN\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And now comes your very first look at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Samsung?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Samsung</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GalaxyZFlip4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GalaxyZFlip4</a>! (360° video + gorgeous 5K renders + dimensions) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FutureSquad?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FutureSquad</a><br><br>This time, on behalf of my Friends over <a href=\"https://twitter.com/91mobiles?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@91mobiles</a> -&gt; <a href=\"https://t.co/ShA5fPfGCr\">https://t.co/ShA5fPfGCr</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ZHt4KYJQJ8\">pic.twitter.com/ZHt4KYJQJ8</a></p>— Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1524411082504343555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 11, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"zCTZJi\">If Samsung is planning for its next Z Flip to be a spec bump, we hope that its specs actually get a decent boost. The rear cameras are in most need of improvement, which were both 12-megapixel last time around at a time when Samsung’s comparatively priced flagship Galaxy S devices are getting 50-megapixel main sensors and higher. Expect an official announcement in August, if Samsung follows the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on\">same schedule as last year</a>.</p>",
