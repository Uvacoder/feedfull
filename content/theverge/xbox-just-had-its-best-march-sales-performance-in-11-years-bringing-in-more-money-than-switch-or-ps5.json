While the Nintendo Switch (including the new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review\">Switch OLED</a> model) and Xbox Series S are generally available throughout the US, it’s a little harder to get something more powerful, and NPD data released today reflects that. </p><p id=\"oUfcZ0\">Between the Xbox Series S remaining in stock consistently and the increasingly obtainable Xbox Series X (try opening up your Best Buy app in the morning or checking local stores to find one — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/20/22946437/microsoft-xbox-series-x-console-restock-availability-check\">many have had them in stock lately</a>), Microsoft’s consoles led in terms of hardware dollars for March 2022 and the entire first quarter in the US. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"nUXIRc\"><q>This is the most total Xbox units sold in March since 2011</q></aside><div id=\"8MSbkZ\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US NPD PREMIUM GAMES - Elden Ring repeated as the best-selling game of the month, as dollar sales experienced double-digit percentage dollar sales growth compared to its Feb 2022 launch.
