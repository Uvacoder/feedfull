However, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/04/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-in-its-all-online-format/\">Apple said</a> it will host an in-person session at Apple Park on June 6th, with some developers and students watching the keynote and State of the Union videos together, along with the online community.</p><p id=\"KccJNa\">WWDC is traditionally a software-focused event where Apple details its forthcoming updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Last year, for example, Apple announced a series of software improvements like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc\">SharePlay support for FaceTime</a>, the ability to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522864/apple-wallet-iphone-airport-ids-hotel-key-card-ios-15-wwdc\">store IDs in digital form in Apple Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/22227853\">widget support for iPadOS</a>, and new privacy features with its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc\">iCloud Plus subscription service</a>. </p><p id=\"sJ5AnH\">But that doesn’t mean WWDC is always exclusively focused on software. Past events have seen the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646424/apple-mac-pro-redesign-new-specs-features-photos-wwdc-2019\">new Mac Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732144/apple-homepod-speaker-announced-siri-price-release-date-wwdc-2017\">HomePod</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/5/15740298/new-apple-imacs-announced-price-specs-release-date-wwdc-2017\">updated iMacs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15732350/new-apple-ipad-announced-price-release-date-wwdc-2017\">iPad Pro</a>. At Apple’s 2021 conference, it announced the transition of the Mac lineup to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020\">its own Arm-based Apple Silicon</a>. With a new M2 processor <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/20/22943411/apple-m2-chip-new-macs-rumor\">rumored to be coming this year</a>, could we see the new chip teased or even announced at WWDC 2022?</p>",
