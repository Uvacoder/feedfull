Google even made <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644368/google-pixel-5a-headphone-jack-ad\">a ridiculous two-minute ad</a> celebrating the headphone jack in the Pixel 5A that parodied Apple’s elaborate design videos. That video was titled, in part, “The Circle Comes Full Circle.” Well, it seems the circle is coming full circle again, as now Google is the one set to drop the headphone jack from its next phone.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"ZnXmHs\"><q>The circle comes full circle</q></aside></div><p id=\"tAPudU\">The thing is, <em>this isn’t even the first time this circle has come full circle</em>. In an ad for the very first Pixel — released in 2016, the same year as the iPhone 7 — <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/pixel-2-xl-no-headphone-jack/\">Google noted this key feature</a>: “3.5mm headphone jack satisfyingly not new.” But the headphone jack was gone from <a href=\"https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/d7b20e55-e717-4250-ae5c-cace852fd75e#:~:text=https%3A//www.theverge.com/2017/10/5/16428570/google%2Dpixel%2D2%2Dno%2Dheadphone%2Djack%2Dapple%2Dwireless%2Dfuture\">the Pixel 2</a> released just a year later. The first A-series Pixel, the Pixel 3A, would bring it back, but not <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18530449/google-pixel-3a-xl-review-photos-video-specs-price-release-date-features-io-2019\">until 2019</a>. Once again, Google has parodied Apple only to become a parody itself the following year.</p><p id=\"xW1kxI\">We’ve asked Google why it is dropping the headphone jack for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23064495/google-pixel-6a-price-specs-screen-tensor-io\">the Pixel 6A</a>. But it’s possible the company wants to make a more convincing case to sell you wireless headphones — and wouldn’t you know it, Google revealed <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23065104/google-pixel-buds-pro-features-price-release-date-io\">the new Pixel Buds Pro</a> at Google I/O as well. </p><aside id=\"Zdskbz\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The Pixel 6A includes Google’s Tensor chipset and costs $449\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23064495/google-pixel-6a-price-specs-screen-tensor-io\"},{\"title\":\"How do the new Google Pixel 6A’s specs stack up to the pricier Pixel 6 models?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23065263/google-pixel-phone-comparison-6a-vs-6-pro-5a-specs\"}]}'></div></aside>",
