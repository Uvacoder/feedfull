I was recently sent such an email letting me know that my monthly bill would go up starting March 30th, 2022 — but some Netflix users may have already seen their bill increases hit.</p><p id=\"YKPJEh\">Netflix spokesperson Kumiko Hidaka told <em>The Verge</em> that the price increases are rolling out to existing subscribers “over weeks,” adding that some subscribers may have already been notified and seen the changes applied.</p><div id=\"o6ktQD\"><iframe title=\"History of Netflix price increases\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-ziYTe\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ziYTe/9/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"  height=\"414\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div><p id=\"4SFon6\"></p><p id=\"w3ALah\">Netflix <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884263/netflix-price-increases-2021-us-canada-all-plans-hd-4k\">first alerted subscribers</a> to its coming price increases in late January. The service’s basic plan now costs $9.99 per month (up from $8.99), its standard tier costs $15.49 per month (up from $13.99), and its 4K tier costs $19.99 per month (up from $17.99). That means Netflix is now charging up to nearly $20 every month for access to its service — a pretty significant milestone for the streamer.</p><p id=\"PiVYY1\">Netflix has long said that it will continue gradually increasing its price relative to the value it provides. That means churning out more TV shows and movies — and now <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22770244/netflix-gaming-app-launch-android-ios-future\">video games</a> — and dumping truckloads of money on bringing that content to life. Short of adding an ad-tier, which Netflix hasn’t indicated it’s planning to do any time soon, Netflix has got to find money for that content from somewhere. Intermittent <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893419/netflix-price-increase-q1-2022-earnings\">price increases</a> and its as-of-yet experimental <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22983315/netflix-password-account-sharing-test-streaming\">password crackdown</a> are two ways of going about it.</p><p id=\"NSUEyo\">In its initial announcement, Netflix said subscribers will be notified by email 30 days before their price changes arrive. And sure, it’s just another buck or two a month, depending on which plan you’re subscribed to. But taken together with all the other stuff we pay to subscribe to — which may be getting their own price hikes — it all starts to add up! Let’s hope those newly announced Netflix <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991170/netflix-mobile-games-first-fps-subscription\">mobile games</a> live up to the hype.</p>",
