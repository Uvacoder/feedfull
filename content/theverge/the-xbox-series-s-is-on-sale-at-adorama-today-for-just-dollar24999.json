Regularly $299.99, <a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107530/1036?subId1=Verge&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fxbrrs00001.html\">Adorama is currently selling the entry-level Xbox for $249.99</a> when you use the promo code <strong>XBOXS2250</strong> at checkout.</p><div id=\"sFO81s\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9444105\"></div></div><aside id=\"YF4vox\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"PSA: the Xbox Series X is (finally) easier to buy \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011418/microsoft-xbox-series-x-console-in-stock-stores-walmart-newegg-costco-availability-check-restock\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"iqZcBF\">While the Xbox Series S lacks a disc drive, it can play the same games as the Series X and is backward compatible with original Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One games. It also targets a 1440p resolution and up to 120fps in supported games (with 4K upscaling), though many games still run at 1080p right now. The console also only offers 512GB of internal storage. However, unlike the Series X, it’s compact enough that you can easily fit it at your desk, in an entertainment center, or just about anywhere. Plus, the next-gen console is less than half the price of the Series X, which currently retails for $499.99. It’s a great little Game Pass machine and the cheapest way to access next-gen gaming.</p><p id=\"esTMqn\">For more details regarding both consoles, you can check out our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21432635/xbox-series-x-s-release-date-news-price-features-specs-hardware-games\">comparison of both</a> and read our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review\">Xbox Series S</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review\">Xbox Series X reviews</a>.</p><aside id=\"DR9dDJ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside><p id=\"vmcrCd\"></p>",
