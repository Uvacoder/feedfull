And, now, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/06/xbox-streaming-stick-when/\">both <em>VentureBeat</em>’s Jeff Grubb</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1522262843931996161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1522262843931996161%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc\"><em>The Verge</em>’s own Tom Warren</a> are reporting that the wait isn’t over. </p><p id=\"6f2Wsv\">Grubb now says we can expect the Xbox puck “in the next 12 months,” which I will remind you is the same exact phrase Spencer uttered 17 months ago, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612714/microsoft-xbox-app-tv-xcloud-streaming-app\">alongside the words</a>, “I don’t think anything is going to stop us from doing that.” (I will also remind you that Microsoft already developed a similar product last decade but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/8/13561868/microsoft-xbox-streaming-stick-tv-devices-codename-project-hobart\">canceled it before a planned E3 2016 debut</a>.)</p><p id=\"d8idox\">But both my colleague Tom — a man who does not quite understand the meaning of the word “vacation” — and Grubb have good reasons to believe Microsoft is serious this time around. They’re both namedropping a so-called “Xbox Everywhere” initiative within Microsoft, and they point to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/5/23058642/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-free-streaming-epic-games-microsoft\">how Microsoft just made <em>Fortnite</em> free to play on any iPhone or Android handset or PC</a> as a signal that the initiative has legs. </p><div id=\"HNKy1W\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Xbox Everywhere includes devices like a TV puck for Xbox Cloud Gaming, apps for TVs, and even Microsoft's original plan to let you play all Xbox games you own through the cloud</p>— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1522262843931996161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 5, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"rSJSsA\">We, at <em>The Verge, </em>have spilled quite a bit of ink writing about <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547334/cloud-gaming-xbox-xcloud-microsoft-streaming-google-stadia-amazon\">how well-positioned Microsoft is with cloud gaming</a> and how its Xbox Game Pass subscription service <em>is</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future\">the true next-gen Xbox</a>, particularly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890553/microsoft-activision-xbox-game-pass-competition-subscription\">now that it’s buying Activision Blizzard</a> and becoming one of the biggest game companies in the world. </p><p id=\"yar1mZ\">Cloud gaming still has a lot to prove, but when you can just slap a controller on a phone <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/21/22894588/nacon-rig-mg-x-review-xbox-mobile-controller\">and call it a portable Xbox</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22985166/xbox-cloud-gaming-steam-deck-microsoft-edge-beta\">load it on a machine like the Steam Deck</a>, it’s hard not to see the potential.</p><aside id=\"CS29MB\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"To succeed, cloud gaming needs to disappear\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547334/cloud-gaming-xbox-xcloud-microsoft-streaming-google-stadia-amazon\"},{\"title\":\"Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft’s true next-gen Xbox\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future\"},{\"title\":\"With Activision, Microsoft is one gigantic step closer to game subscription dominance\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890553/microsoft-activision-xbox-game-pass-competition-subscription\"},{\"title\":\"When I don’t buy the new Xbox, Microsoft will laugh all the way to the bank\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21364626/xbox-series-x-pc-game-pass-xcloud-strategy\"}]}'></div></aside>",
