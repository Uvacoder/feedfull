However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.</p><p id=\"4B19IV\">That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best deals on noise-canceling headphones. Here, you’ll find sales on all kinds of on-ear and over-ear headphones, all of which are designed to eliminate outside noise but come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a buying decision, we’ve put together a guide to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones\">best noise-canceling headphones</a>, which can help you determine which is right for you.</p><aside id=\"L17MDv\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats\"},{\"title\":\"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"VFH8rh\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10961832\"></div></div><h2 id=\"9kUVb8\">Sony WH-1000XM4 deals</h2><p id=\"XtIOrp\">Sony’s WH-1000XM4 is our overall pick for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones\">best noise-canceling headphones</a>. They offer excellent noise-canceling, good sound and voice quality, and the ability to pair to two devices simultaneously. You can wear these for long periods of time as well, as their plush ear pads make them comfortable to wear for as long as you need. They can even last up to 30 hours on a single charge and can be charged via USB-C.</p><p id=\"VRoMJX\">During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the $349.99 headphones drop to $248 — their lowest price to date.

They’re lightweight and foldable, so you can easily carry them around with you, and ear fatigue is unlikely, thanks to their oval ear cups. Battery life now sits at 24 hours as well, meaning you needn’t worry about constantly having to charge them. The new transparency mode, meanwhile, comes in handy when you need to be more aware of your surroundings, like when you’re about to cross the street, while a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22937488/bose-qc45-custom-eq-bass-mid-treble-now-available\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently-introduced firmware update</a> allows you to customize the bass, mid-range, and other aspects of the EQ.

The headphones pair seamlessly with other Apple devices and sound superb, especially combined with Apple’s surround sound-like spatial audio feature, which allows for a more immersive experience when listening to or watching select content. They also tout the best transparency mode of all the headphones on our list and boast incredible build quality thanks to a luxe design that opts for aluminum, steel, and fabric over plastic.</p><p id=\"aqkx5j\">At $549, these headphones are expensive, but many retailers have been heavily discounting them as of late. Right now, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZD76NP/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1159614/9383?sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Max-Silver%2F774269130&amp;veh=aff\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> are selling the AirPods Max for around $449 — with the discount applying at checkout, in some instances — which is about $20 shy of their best price to date.

The headphones also offer intuitive dial controls for both volume and noise cancellation, as well as improved sound quality and battery life over their predecessor. While Microsoft’s noise-canceling tech isn’t quite as effective as Bose’s and Sony’s, the Surface Headphones 2 still adequately silence outside noises so you can focus.</p><p id=\"slxuWB\">During Black Friday, Microsoft’s $249.99 Surface Headphones 2 dropped down to around $162, which is almost half their typical retail price.

They boast excellent voice call quality, meaning everybody on your Zoom call will be able to hear you loud and clearly, and they offer great noise cancellation with satisfactory sound. Like the QC45, the over-ears can also connect to two devices simultaneously, but they can’t be folded and only offer 20 hours of battery life, which is also less than other headphones on this list provide.</p><p id=\"FueOFu\">We’ve seen several discounts on the 700s over the past year or so, with the best reaching an all-time low of $299.

The Beats Studio 3 are comfortable to wear, fold inward for easy stowing, and feature Apple’s last-gen W1 wireless chip, which allows you to quickly connect and switch between Apple devices. Note, however, unlike those built with Apple’s newer H1 chip, the headphones lack hands-free Siri support.
