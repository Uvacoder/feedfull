However, they can be expensive and difficult to shop for due to the range of available models, many of which cater to different lifestyles and priorities. Some are better suited for long-haul flights, for instance, while others are ideal for multitasking and marathon listening sessions.</p><p id=\"4B19IV\">That’s why we’ve curated this list of the best deals on noise-canceling headphones. Here, you’ll find sales on all kinds of on-ear and over-ear headphones, all of which are designed to eliminate outside noise but come with their own strengths and weaknesses. And if you want to do even more research before making a buying decision, we’ve put together a guide to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones\">best noise-canceling headphones</a>, which can help you determine which is right for you.</p><aside id=\"L17MDv\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats\"},{\"title\":\"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"VFH8rh\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10961832\"></div></div><h2 id=\"Peel4Y\">Bose QuietComfort 45 deals</h2>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kgeEn8QS5fmt3RpAGVjzP1b7lgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883429/cwelch_202109_4775_5635.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>Bose QuietComfort 45s are our pick for the most comfortable noise-canceling headphones.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"NA49IA\">Bose QuietComfort 45s, our pick for the most comfortable noise-canceling headphones, are a pair frequent travelers will surely appreciate. They’re lightweight and foldable, so you can easily carry them around with you, and ear fatigue is unlikely, thanks to their oval ear cups. Battery life now sits at 24 hours as well, meaning you needn’t worry about constantly having to charge them. The new transparency mode, meanwhile, comes in handy when you need to be more aware of your surroundings, like when you’re about to cross the street, while a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22937488/bose-qc45-custom-eq-bass-mid-treble-now-available\">recently-introduced firmware update</a> allows you to customize the bass, mid-range, and other aspects of the EQ. The USB-C-equipped headphones don’t offer the same bassy response as Sony’s 1000XM4s, but if comfort is what you’re after, the QC45 offer it in spades.</p><p id=\"tHEs6C\">While we’ve seen the QC45 drop to as low as $279, right now there are no discounts that steep available. However, <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeHeadphones032222/https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort-headphones-45.html?#v=qc45_black\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you can save 15 percent on a pair when you buy two</a> of the QuietComfort 45s, QuietComfort Earbuds, or Sport Earbuds, in any combination, from Bose. Keep in mind that the discount will apply to the cheaper of the two models, and you must buy both at the same time to take advantage of the deal.  <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"Joupef\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10893423\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKJX7PSEe5X-Kz5k3R15GB486NA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173543/IMG_6828_3.jpg\">      <cite>Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge</cite>      <figcaption><em>The AirPods Max is a good pick for those deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem.</em></figcaption>  </figure><h2 id=\"Yu5lCJ\">Apple’s AirPods Max deals</h2><p id=\"UfClp3\">If you’re looking for the best sound quality you can get in a pair of noise-canceling headphones, we recommend the AirPods Max. The headphones pair seamlessly with other Apple devices, and they sound superb, especially combined with Apple’s spatial audio feature, which allows for a more immersive experience when listening to or watching compatible content. They also tout the best transparency mode of all the headphones on our list, and they boast incredible build quality thanks to a luxe design that opts for aluminum, steel, and fabric over plastic.</p><p id=\"aqkx5j\">At $549, these headphones are usually very expensive, but many retailers have been discounting them as of late. Right now, for instance, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZD76NP/?ots=1&amp;slotNum=37&amp;imprToken=48c02469-c446-2932-43d&amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21066092%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">silver</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS/?ots=1&amp;slotNum=38&amp;imprToken=48c02469-c446-2932-43d&amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21066092%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gray</a> AirPods Max are currently on sale at Amazon for $450, a discount you’ll see at checkout.

The budget-friendly headphones come with an “Artificial Intelligence Noise Cancellation” feature, which, according to Sony, will automatically select the proper noise cancellation mode based on the sound levels in your environment.

The Beats Studio 3 are comfortable to wear, fold inward for easy stowing, and feature Apple’s last-gen W1 wireless chip, which still allow you to quickly connect and switch between Apple devices. Note, however, that unlike those built with Apple’s newer H1 chip, the headphones lack hands-free Siri support.
