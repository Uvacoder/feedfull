We haven’t found the notice elsewhere, but a Board representative <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/bioware-qa-union-mass-effect-dragon-age-star-wars-keywo-1848839482\">confirmed to <em>Kotaku</em></a><em> </em>that it was accurate. </p><p id=\"i854jZ\">The Board will next determine if the application meets certain requirements, including “at least 40 percent support from employees” in the proposed unit. If that’s the case, the unit can hold a secret ballot to have the UFCW represent them in bargaining. The Board and the UFCW haven’t replied to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Hxio8PJEKiYNjY80WitkoDU0zg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23415956/igr6jjda1qv81.png\">      <cite>Image: <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/ubsgsv/ufcw_local_401_labour_board_union_application_for/\" target=\"_blank\">u/KeywordsUnitedYEG on r/alberta</a></cite>      <figcaption><em>Here is the notice that was shared on Reddit.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"gnRJBw\">This is still an early step, but it arrives amid a growing labor movement in gaming as studios like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21314714/ubisoft-harassment-kotaku-toxic-culture\">Ubisoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay\">Activision Blizzard</a> have come under scrutiny for their treatment of workers. Employees at Vodeo Games created the first video game union in North America <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/22834924/vodeo-games-first-video-game-union-north-america-code-cwa\">in December</a>, and just last week, the National Labor Relations Board said that twenty-one QA staffers at Raven Software, an Activision Blizzard-owned studio that works on the <em>Call of Duty</em> series, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/22/23037874/raven-software-qa-employees-union-election-activision-blizzard-nlrb\">will be allowed to have a union election</a>.</p><p id=\"1Wvsrc\">It’s unclear how BioWare, parent company EA, or Keywords Studios may respond to the organizing efforts, and none immediately responded to requests for comment from <em>The Verge </em>or <em>Kotaku</em>.</p>",
