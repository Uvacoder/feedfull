The game company shared the news <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1517896643345108995\">on Twitter</a> after leakers posted footage of the game, codenamed <em>Project Q</em>, online.</p><p id=\"LEIXiF\">“This is not a Battle Royale,” Ubisoft said in a series of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1517896646113345539\">tweets</a>. “The game will feature a variety of PvP modes with one single goal in mind: FUN! We don’t have plans to add NFTs to this game, you can find out more by registering and taking part in the upcoming tests!”</p><div id=\"Tqa3k9\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, we heard you heard...  <br><br>‍Introducing codename “Project Q”, a team battle arena letting players truly own the experience! The game is in early development and we will keep testing, so for now all you can do is register for upcoming tests: <a href=\"https://t.co/TMRKwiUzbJ\">https://t.co/TMRKwiUzbJ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hZ40OkPdum\">pic.twitter.com/hZ40OkPdum</a></p>— Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1517896643345108995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"0SevZi\">As noted in Ubisoft’s tweet, you can sign up for upcoming tests for the Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC on <a href=\"https://register.ubisoft.com/projectq-signup/en-US\">Ubisoft’s website</a>. There’s no word on when the tests will become available, or whether the game will be free-to-play in its final form. Ubisoft did <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1517900203625439233\">reassure players</a>, however, that the “Q” in <em>Project Q</em> won’t stand for “Quartz,” the name of the company’s divisive <a href=\"https://quartz.ubisoft.com/\">in-game NFT initiative</a> it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint\">slid into <em>Ghost Recon</em></a>. </p><p id=\"L8iK71\"><em>Project Q</em> footage from video game leaker <a href=\"https://exputer.com/news/industry/ubisoft-project-q/\">Tom Henderson</a> shows a <em>Fortnite</em> meets <em>Overwatch</em> type of aesthetic. It also appears to feature two modes as of right now: Showdown (battle royale) and Battle Zone (territory control). The game is still in early development, so all of this is subject to change. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to Ubisoft with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.</p><p id=\"rpvQTU\">Ubisoft launched a short-lived free-to-play battle royale, called <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21309355/ubisoft-hyper-scape-battle-royale-launch-announced-pc\"><em>Hyper Scape</em></a>, in 2020. The futuristic shooter put a twist on the traditional battle royale, but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365476/ubisoft-hyper-scape-twitch-launch-rough-low-viewership-battle-royale\">its popularity waned quickly</a>, leading to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22904775/ubisoft-hyper-scape-cancelled-battle-royale\">its ultimate shutdown on April 28th, 2022</a>. </p><aside id=\"NqEnei\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Many game developers hate NFTs, too \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893216/gdc-annual-survey-2022-game-developers-nfts\"}]}'></div></aside>",
