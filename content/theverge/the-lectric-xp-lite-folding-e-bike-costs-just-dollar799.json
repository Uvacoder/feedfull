That’s incredibly inexpensive at a time when transportation costs, combined with chip and component shortages, are driving up prices across the e-bike industry. Better yet, it’s apparently not junk.</p><p id=\"PgbqxH\"><em>Electrek’s</em> Micah Toll, who’s ridden more US e-bikes than anyone I know, had the chance to ride the new Lectric XP Lite ahead of production. He says it’s “<a href=\"https://electrek.co/2022/04/11/lectric-xp-lite-electric-bike-launched-first-test-ride/\">the #1 electric bike I will recommend to anyone shopping on a tight budget</a>.” High praise.</p><div id=\"jpsFRO\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/698352039?h=664b63bb87&amp;app_id=122963&amp;byline=0&amp;badge=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"pOjkqj\">The Lectric XP Lite iterates on the company’s XP and XP 2.0 models, only it’s now lighter (but not light at 53 pounds / 24kg with battery) and more compact, while also being more maneuverable according to the company.</p><p id=\"CglFjh\">The class 2 e-bike is fitted with a 300W (capable of a 720W peak) rear hub motor that tops out at 20mph (32km/h). It’s powered by a 375Wh-capacity battery that’s good for about 15 miles (24km) using only the throttle, or 40 miles (64km) in the lowest pedal-assist mode.</p><p id=\"YQnjXL\">Best of all, if you’re in the US then you can rely upon local shipping and support from the Arizona-based company, unlike anyone that bought the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/8/23016232/fiido-x-break-in-two-recall\">cheap but dangerous Fiido X</a> which is now facing a global recall. </p><p id=\"YuMJwN\">The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flectricebikes.com%2Fproducts%2Fxp-lite-arctic-white&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F4%2F12%2F23021623%2Fcheap-folding-ebike-price-specs-date\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lectric XP Lite</a> comes in four colors — white, blue, black, and “sand” — and ships in a relatively quick four to five weeks.</p>",
