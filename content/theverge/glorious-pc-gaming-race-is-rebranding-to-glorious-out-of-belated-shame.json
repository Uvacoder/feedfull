(I remember it being quite funny at the time.)</p><p id=\"ki6Gq0\">Then, something unfortunate happened: the PC gaming community <em>decided to brand itself</em> <em>that way</em>. “PC Gaming Master Race” became <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/\">the community’s biggest subreddit</a>, and in 2014, some guy also decided he’d use it to sell mousepads, mice, and keyboards to people, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_race\">Nazi-era connotations</a> be damned.</p><p id=\"xZjYSM\"><em>Some guy</em> has now realized the error of his ways — and so his company, “Glorious PC Gaming Race,” is ditching the name. It’s just “Glorious” now; the logo and products are going to change, and the company says its website <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpcgamingrace.com&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F23032799%2Fglorious-pc-gaming-race-pc-peripherals-mouse-keyboard-brand\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pcgamingrace.com</a> will be retired in favor of a new domain name. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"TMd5SW\"><q>It’s a meme, but not just a meme</q></aside></div><p id=\"UcrkwS\">“The intention of this rebrand is to better align the public face of the fast-growing startup with its own core values,” reads a press release, which quickly points out that founder Shazim Mohammad was 24 years old when he started the company and implies he didn’t know better — he was just going along with the meme. (Then it points out how successful the branding was: “The unusual name drew attention within the crowded industry, especially from other members of those online communities,” it reads.)</p><p id=\"pi9fSc\">I am older and definitely should have known better, but I admit my own “Glorious PC Gaming Race” mousepad snuck into the photos for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs\">my Odyssey G9 monitor review</a> before I retired it in shame. </p><p id=\"jgF299\">Unfortunately, it sounds like it may be a while before the company can truly ditch the phrase that apparently served its business well until today. It will be a “multi-year transition period,” the company writes, though <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/13/23020482/glorious-model-i-wired-gaming-mouse-pc-race-features-price\">new product launches</a> are already going that way.</p><p id=\"rv3NfE\">While we’re on the topic of cringe gamer branding... Acer, are you listening?
