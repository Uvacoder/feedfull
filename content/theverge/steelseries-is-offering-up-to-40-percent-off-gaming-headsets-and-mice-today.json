While the discounts on individual items may range, there are some great deals to be had — including some that are available at new all-time lows.</p><p id=\"iz8x1j\">The Arctis 7P Plus, for instance, is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy\">our pick for the best wireless gaming headset for PlayStation consoles</a>, but it also works with Windows PCs, the Nintendo Switch, smartphones, and the Oculus / Meta Quest 2. While it’s on the premium side and usually retails for about $70 more than Sony’s own Pulse 3D headset, it offers great battery life, USB-C charging, an easy-to-use audio dial, rotatable ear cups that allow for easier storage, and adequate comfort for use during long gaming sessions. It’s even compatible with the PlayStation 5’s 3D audio.</p><p id=\"XRRbvL\">With SteelSeries’ <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-7p-plus%3Fcolor%3Dblack&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F5%2F14%2F23068558%2Fsteelseries-arctis-gaming-headset-aerox-3-mouse-razer-kiyo-pro-webcam-google-pixel-6-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discount of 20 percent on the Arctis 7P Plus, the black model drops to a new low price of $135.99</a> — a savings of $34. You also get free shipping and a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-accessories%2Farctis-carrying-bag&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F5%2F14%2F23068558%2Fsteelseries-arctis-gaming-headset-aerox-3-mouse-razer-kiyo-pro-webcam-google-pixel-6-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">carrying bag</a> when you add the headset to your cart. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy\"><strong>Read our gaming headset buying guide</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"F0tlFn\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10866865\"></div></div>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vIWJY5MNqejYrh4WpjSroAIUBg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23463921/SteelSeries_Aerox_3_Wireless_Lifestyle_Press_Image.jpg\">      <cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite>      <figcaption>SteelSeries’ Aerox 3 Wireless packs more than just a few incremental upgrades.</figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"ApgElt\">Another notable deal from the SteelSeries spring sale is the discounted Aerox 3 Wireless. This lightweight gaming mouse weighs just 68 grams, and its honeycomb design is filled with colorful RGB lighting. The 2022 model normally runs $99.99 but <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Faerox-3-2022%3Fconnectivity%3Dwireless%26mouse-body-color%3Donyx&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F5%2F14%2F23068558%2Fsteelseries-arctis-gaming-headset-aerox-3-mouse-razer-kiyo-pro-webcam-google-pixel-6-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you can get it for just $64.99 in black or white along with a free mousepad when you add it to your cart</a>.</p><p id=\"9iw5aW\">A further strength of this mouse is that it can be used either via Bluetooth or with its included 2.4GHz wireless USB dongle, which you can use to switch between two machines on the fly. It’s advertised to have up to 200 hours of battery life, but in actual use, it lasts a couple of days at most with the lighting on. Though, thankfully, it charges via USB-C.</p><div id=\"b6pNwu\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10221749\"></div></div><aside id=\"KamgX3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"H3PGtx\">If you missed yesterday’s news that <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> podcast <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/13/23071134/ttrpgs-reproductive-rights-itchio-bundle\"><em>Roll for Romance</em> has partnered with itch.io</a> to offer a massive bundle of tabletop RPGs as a fundraiser for reproductive rights, you’ve got plenty of time to join in. This promotion brings together over 200 creators that have donated their digital games and assets, and <a href=\"https://itch.io/b/1375/ttrpgs-for-reproductive-rights\">you get over 275 of them — DRM-free — with a donation of $5 or more</a>. It’s very similar to previous fundraisers that <a href=\"http://itch.io\">itch.io</a> has run, like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22967069/itch-io-ukraine-bundle-support-charity\">the most recent one in support of Ukraine</a>. This one runs until June 13th, and if it’s like those prior, it’s possible more games will be added to the mix as it continues to raise money beyond its initial fundraising goal.</p><div id=\"dTnQ9i\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11191515\"></div></div><p id=\"iGVWyD\">If you’re in need of a webcam, the Razer Kiyo Pro is currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kiyo-Streaming-Webcam-High-Performance/dp/B08T1MWX6J?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cheAqXXwdZo\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> for $99.99. The $100 discount makes the accessory more worthwhile than when it first came out, which saw it retail for $199.99. It’s got some decent specs, including the ability to capture 1080p footage at up to 60fps and a wide 103-degree field of view that you can easily crop for tighter framing — as long you don’t mind using Razer’s Synapse software.</p><p id=\"XIpUlY\">The Kiyo Pro is a bit of a mixed bag, but it ultimately does a nice job with tricky lighting and manages to produce smooth, detailed video. It’s just a bit pricey for what it offers and what it’s missing, like 4K resolution, but the current discount makes it a far better value. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22295235/razer-kiyo-pro-webcam-review-adjustable-field-of-view-streaming-zoom-video-calls-price-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><aside id=\"ygelVb\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best webcam to buy right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22652783/best-webcam-camera\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"RqMDY5\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10730624\"></div></div><p id=\"poyb1E\">Google <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23067073/google-pixel-7-pro-release-design-tensor\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">briefly previewed the forthcoming Pixel 7</a> and announced the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23064495/google-pixel-6a-price-specs-screen-tensor-io\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">budget-friendly Pixel 6A smartphone</a> during its developers conference on Wednesday. While the 6A will offer Google’s flagship-level Tensor CPU for $449, it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/11/23067702/google-pixel-6a-headphone-jack\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">lacks a headphone jack</a> and bucks the trend of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/12/23067680/google-pixel-6a-phone-camera-tensor\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A-series phones using the same camera system as their pricier brethren</a>.</p><p id=\"vN9Lp1\">But if you’re in the market for the very best from Google — and you want maximum camera performance — <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HZH2VJH?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon is selling an unlocked, 128GB Pixel 6 Pro in the two-tone white colorway for $856.57</a>. This modest discount of around $42 nets you an unlocked phone to use on any carrier, as well as Google’s triple-camera system, which includes a 50MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide, and a 48MP 4x magnification telephoto lens. It’s also got a larger, 6.7-inch display with a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like in the top-tier Pixel, and they are features that stand well above the upcoming budget model. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our Pixel 6 Pro review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"NxADZZ\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10815902\"></div></div><h2 id=\"A0qjtV\">Some additional gaming deals to sweeten your Saturday</h2><ul><li id=\"li0o2z\">In addition to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23064994/gotham-knights-gameplay-trailer-xbox-ps5\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not coming to last-gen consoles</a>, Warner Bros.
