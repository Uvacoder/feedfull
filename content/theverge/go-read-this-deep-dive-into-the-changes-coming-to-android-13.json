It’s a thorough and organized changelog — <a href=\"https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#table-of-contents\">with a table of contents</a> — of developer preview 2 of the unreleased Android 13 and <a href=\"https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/\">reads as if it’s an official internal guide for all the changes</a>.</p><p id=\"fqX0ck\">This thoroughly documented changelog of Android 13 is written by none other than former <em>XDA Developers</em> editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman — who last year uncovered the technical reason why Microsoft Teams and Android 12 caused a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828234/microsoft-teams-android-bug-blocked-911-call-go-read-this\">failed emergency call</a>. You <a href=\"https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/#hub_mode\">might even catch foreshadowing of future products Google appears to be working on</a> — like a rumored Nest Hub and other tablets that are hinted at by a USB API change and code for communal “hub mode” mode features to let multiple people use apps on the same device.</p><div id=\"665Vag\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">USB HAL is getting updated to 2.0, adding a limitPowerTransfer system API and support for USB audio docks. Yet another change aimed at improving the docked tablet experience amidst rumors of the 2022 Nest Hub moving to that form factor.<a href=\"https://t.co/IJvYMscAH8\">https://t.co/IJvYMscAH8</a></p>— Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1514682078184443904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 14, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"Z2LN2z\">You know who you are: a tinkerer, developer, programmer for the Microsoft Teams Android app, or maybe just a user interface connoisseur — that’s why you <a href=\"https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/\">should read this deep dive </a>so that there’s very little left to catch you by surprise when the update officially launches.
