Developer Epic Games is rolling out <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/whats-new-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-3-season-2-resistance\">Chapter 3: Season 2</a> of the long-running battle royale, and it’s called Resistance; a story trailer (embedded above) features a number of opposing forces duking it out on the <em>Fortnite</em> island, along with a certain sorcerer from the Marvel universe.</p><p id=\"QpxN7H\">Ahead of the season’s official announcement, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/20/22986671/epic-fortnite-season-2-ukraine-relief\">Epic said that it would donate two weeks of its <em>Fortnite</em> proceeds to support Ukraine-related humanitarian efforts</a>. This will last from March 20th through April 3rd.</p><p id=\"8B8bLh\">The season makes a few big changes to the game. The most extreme is that, at least right now, building has been “wiped out,” removing one of the most distinct aspects of <em>Fortnite</em> play. To balance this out, players now have an additional shield — called an “overshield” — for defense. Other changes include a combination of faster sprinting and climbing that makes for parkour-like movement, the addition of blimps to explore and tanks to drive, as well as a handful of new guns. And if players donate enough gold over the course of the season, they will unlock a drivable version of the iconic battle bus, which now looks like something out of <em>Mad Max</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAIqgrZOLXDk0N8mGZD8ihn3njI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23331420/fortnite_chapter_3_season_2_agility_uprising_1200x607_d96186ccc35c.jpg\">  </figure><p id=\"SMQoRS\">In addition to the changes to the game and island, <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/chapter-3-season-2\">the new season’s battle pass</a> also adds a handful of unlockable characters for those who purchase it. The most notable is Doctor Strange — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/13/22929388/multiverse-of-madness-superbowl-trailer\">who will be returning to theaters in May</a> — and he’s joined by new faces with names like The Imagined and The Origin. For those who follow <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games\"><em>Fortnite</em>’s ever-expanding lore</a>, this season seems like it will be full of important details.</p><p id=\"VTQ8Ih\">Season 2 follows an eventful start to the game’s latest chapter, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22817392/fortnite-chapter-3-season-1-spider-man-new-island\">which kicked off last December</a>. The previous season introduced destructive weather, faster movement, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22888226/fortnite-update-tilted-towers-monsters-kaws\">giant monsters</a>, along with collaborations with everyone from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22915003/fortnite-bruno-mars-anderson-paak\">Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/28/22954749/naomi-osaka-fortnite\">Naomi Osaka</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891305/fortnite-kaws-art-gallery\">There was even a virtual art gallery for players to explore</a>.</p>",
