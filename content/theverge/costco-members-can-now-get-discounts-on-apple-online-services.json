The big-box retailer has discounted subscriptions for <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/apple-arcade-1-year-subscription.product.100851274.html\">Apple Arcade</a>, <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/apple-news%2b-1-year-subscription.product.100851261.html\">Apple News Plus</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/apple-tv%2b-1-year-subscription.product.100851281.html\">Apple TV Plus</a> (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/19/costco-discounted-apple-subscriptions/\">via <em>MacRumors</em></a>). The going rate for a year of Apple TV Plus or Apple Arcade is usually $49.99, but either one is currently available through Costco for $44.99. A year of Apple News Plus would usually cost $119.99 when purchased on a month-to-month basis directly from Apple, but Costco has discounted that same subscription to just $89.99. </p><aside id=\"weGRJX\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"5 great Apple Arcade games you may have missed\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20972770/apple-arcade-game-reviews-guildlings-pilgrims-manifold-garden\"},{\"title\":\"Apple will take a smaller cut of publishers’ sales if they join Apple News\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642902/apple-news-partner-program-lower-commission\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"DQ4Ic3\">As the name suggests, Apple Arcade grants access to a number of exclusive mobile games that are unavailable on other devices. Just note that you’ll have to pay a fee to purchase games in addition to your Apple Arcade subscription.</p><p id=\"LhlFX1\">Apple News Plus consolidates the paid subscriptions from a number of news outlets including the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. You also get unlimited access to a wide variety of magazines, like <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Popular Science</em>, <em>Sports Illustrated</em>, and <em>Wired</em>. </p><p id=\"bAw5V9\">Like many other streaming services, Apple TV Plus comes with its own library of original and exclusive content. This platform is the only place you can currently enjoy shows like <em>Ted Lasso, For All Mankind</em>, and <em>Central Park.</em> However, unlike other Apple services, Apple TV Plus is available on a variety of platforms outside of the Apple ecosystem, including Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices.</p><aside id=\"pTX5N8\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
