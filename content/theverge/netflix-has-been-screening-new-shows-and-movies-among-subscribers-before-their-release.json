Subscribers who participate in the feedback panels will watch “several upcoming movies and series over the course of about six months,” <em>Variety</em> says, and after they finish watching a piece of content, they’re asked to fill out a survey. The company then takes that feedback into account for potential changes ahead of a film or show’s debut.</p><p id=\"yBAtZw\">Netflix is well-known for testing many of its software features ahead of wider releases, like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151327/netflix-top-10-list-homepage-subscribers-originals-licensed-movies-tv-shows\">the Top 10 row</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407467/netflix-play-something-shuffle-feature-launch-tv-movie\">“Play Something” shuffle feature</a>, so it’s perhaps not too surprising that the company is also testing its content with small groups of users. The company has apparently been doing this since May 2021.</p><p id=\"NIiZDq\">The groups could help Netflix zero in on potential hits as it tries to weather the fallout from its latest earnings report, where it reported losing subscribers <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23032399/netflix-lost-subscribers-q1-2022-earnings\">for the first time in over a decade</a>. Just today, Netflix laid off <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/17/23103131/netflix-layoffs-tudum-streaming-subscriber-loss-email\">150 employees and at least 26 contractors</a>, and those cuts follow <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23047113/netflix-tudum-editorial-layoffs-streaming\">additional layoffs from April</a>. The company has also announced that it is going to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23065126/netflix-login-sharing-rollout-ads\">launch an ad-supported plan</a> and that it’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23032643/netflix-password-sharing-subscribers-100-million\">cracking down on password sharing</a>. </p><p id=\"KP5cve\"><em>Disclosure: </em>The Verge<em> is currently producing a series with Netflix.</em></p>",
