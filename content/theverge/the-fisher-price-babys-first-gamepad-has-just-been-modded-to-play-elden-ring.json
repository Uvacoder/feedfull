So yeah, he’s largely playing games with the actual Fisher-Price gamepad, not just using a Fisher-Price gamepad as a shell. You do have to plug it in, though: “Not much space for batteries sadly,” he says, since the Arduino is taking up that room.</p><div id=\"8MAZaR\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IT'S DONE<br><br>BUT IT WON'T CLOSE <a href=\"https://t.co/kIq9EbwXYW\">pic.twitter.com/kIq9EbwXYW</a></p>— Rudeism (@rudeism) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1520504573428781057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"0zbpvg\">How does he get every Xbox button out of these limited controls, you might ask? Well, you can’t get ‘em all at once. But he did rig up the Fisher-Price slider as a mode selector that can let you have either a left <em>or </em>right analog stick at any given moment, as well as access to Start, Select and Guide buttons on A, B, and C. The “bumpers” can be both bumpers and triggers all on their own because they’ll press a different switch depending on whether you rock them left or right. </p><div id=\"EUXlin\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The yellow slider makes the stick work as either LS or RS, and it changes the ABCD buttons to handle Start/Select/Guide<br><br>the bumpers can be tilted left or right, so they handle LB/LT and RT/LB on their own   <a href=\"https://t.co/UkM1W1raq1\">https://t.co/UkM1W1raq1</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ff3JzE5PrH\">pic.twitter.com/ff3JzE5PrH</a></p>— Rudeism (@rudeism) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1520595630334177280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"T2MPXC\">Rudeism says it was a two-week backburner project, and started as a joke: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1514958006940692480\">deal hunter Wario64 tweeted</a> that the gamepad would be “perfect for Elden Ring,” and he decided to put that to the test. Unfortunately, there’s no footage of Rudeism destroying bosses with the baby gamepad quite yet, but he says he’s planning on beating the whole game this way (he’s also working on a YouTube build video if you want to try it too). The total budget was $20, including the controller itself — but admittedly not the old 3D printer he used to make mounts to keep the joystick and switches in position.</p><p id=\"gDU2o6\">I don’t know if I’ll build one of these with my now-two-year-old’s pad, but it is a joy to see this hunk of plastic and circuitry in the headlines once again.</p><aside id=\"J6fO39\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Today I learned my baby’s Fisher-Price gamepad accepts the Konami Code\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/21133169/fisher-price-konami-code-baby-toy-game-and-learn-controller\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"lAYPeB\"></p><p id=\"to5B4j\"></p><p id=\"G7Smu2\"></p><p id=\"7CNnXi\"></p><p id=\"eIin1W\"></p><p id=\"yYh2Qq\"></p>",
