As Sonic fans flail about, overjoyed that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/20/23033583/sonic-origins-sega-hedgehog-ps5-xbox\"><em>Sonic Origins</em> will be launching soon</a>, some fans expressed dismay that the franchise’s blue-headed stepchild <em>Sonic Spinball</em> seems to have been forgotten in all these anniversary bundles and rereleases yet again. Nintendo heard those cries of injustice and is adding the “what if Sonic was a pinball?” game to the Sega Genesis library in the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing\">Switch Online Expansion Pack</a>.</p><div id=\"N8WuYm\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3 classic SEGA Genesis games have just been made available for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitchOnline?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NintendoSwitchOnline</a> + Expansion Pack members!<br><br>- Space Harrier II<br>- Shining Force II<br>- Sonic The Hedgehog Spinball <a href=\"https://t.co/uhD21PEChk\">pic.twitter.com/uhD21PEChk</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1517307597593919489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 22, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"o3BnCM\">Released in 1993 on the Sega Genesis, <em>Sonic Spinball</em> is a clunky pinball platformer. Sonic rolls around, buffeted by player-controlled paddles, in search of, what else, Chaos Emeralds. The controls are fiddly, the platforming can get very confusing, and the game churns like an arthritic milkmaid whenever there’s more than two moving things on the screen. But it’s Sonic, and I love him so this is what I’m going to occupy my time with while I wait for <em>Sonic Origins</em>. It’s a hard life.</p><p id=\"jgRmxf\">For the <em>Sonic</em> agnostic, Nintendo is also releasing tactical RPG <em>Shining Force II</em> and rail shooter <em>Space Harrier II</em>. I wish I knew more about these games but you can tell where I invested my childhood time, sorry. </p><p id=\"TAjugg\">These new additions bring the total number of Genesis games available on the Expansion Pack premium service to 25 and are available to Expansion Pack members today.</p>",
