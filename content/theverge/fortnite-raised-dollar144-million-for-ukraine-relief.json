The funds are being put towards several aid groups, including Direct Relief, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children’s Fund, and the World Food Programme.</p><p id=\"WY40Ad\">Epic’s efforts are just one of several Ukraine-related fundraising initiatives from game developers. Last month, <em>League of Legends</em> developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1509200557621325839\">Riot Games raised $5.4 million</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/8/22967069/itch-io-ukraine-bundle-support-charity\">a bundle of nearly 1,000 games on Itch.io</a> took in more than $6 million, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/18/22983137/humble-bundle-stand-with-ukraine-charity-bundle-price\">Humble Bundle</a> managed to raise $20 million.</p><p id=\"d3nLL3\">The current season of <em>Fortnite</em> has been an eventful one. It initially launched without a key feature: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/20/22987308/fortnite-chapter-3-season-2-battle-pass-doctor-strange\">building</a>. Since then, Epic has introduced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23001300/fortnite-zero-build-mode\">a combat-focused Zero Build mode</a> for the game, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/2/22999741/fortnite-chapter-3-season-2-building-returns-zero-build-mode\">this past weekend, it re-added building to its core battle royale</a>.</p>",
