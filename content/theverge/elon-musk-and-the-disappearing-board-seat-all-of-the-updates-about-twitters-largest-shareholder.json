The company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011256/elon-musk-twitter-board-of-directors-ownership\">announced</a> Musk would take a seat on its board of directors, but within the space of a week, that plan unraveled, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/10/23019802/elon-musk-not-joining-twitter-board-announced\">Musk informed the board he will not accept the position</a>. What is Elon up to now?</p><p id=\"0A6Nxl\">In the midst of all of this, Musk appears to have run afoul of a few SEC rules while continuing to thumb his nose at the agency that charged him with securities fraud <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/29/17918252/elon-musk-tesla-sec-securities-fraud-lawsuit-settlement-fine-penalty\">over a tweet</a>.</p><p id=\"Vhz83Z\">Musk, who already leads Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink, is one of Twitter’s most visible users, with a large <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17505744/elon-musk-fans-tesla-spacex-fandom\">audience of devoted followers</a>. The billionaire exec spontaneously shares earthshaking company plans, uncredited memes, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20994895/elon-musk-testimony-vernon-unsworth-tweet-negligence-la-courthouse\">bizarre accusations</a>. That’s in addition to responses that serve as a global tech support line for people who want everything from help with their electric car to politicians seeking satellite internet so they can keep citizens connected during a war. </p><p id=\"7VQfd8\">The Musk era at Twitter included a surprise reveal that it will <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011327/twitter-edit-button-blue-test\">test an edit button for tweets</a> soon — news that the company insists had nothing to do with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011134/twitter-elon-musk-edit-button\">a poll that its almost board member posted </a>about the feature just before it was confirmed. The company also clarified that a board seat <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011558/twitter-elon-musk-board-members-special-exceptions-moderation-rules\">would not exempt Musk from its moderation policies</a>.</p><p id=\"N4gNY3\">After a tumultuous week, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/10/23019802/elon-musk-not-joining-twitter-board-announced\">Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced that Musk declined the board seat</a>, which would release the world’s richest human from his commitment to not acquire more than 14.9 percent of the company’s shares. In a letter to Twitter employees, Agrawal said, “There will be distractions ahead, but our goals and priorities remain unchanged.” He also asked employees to “tune out the noise.” </p><p id=\"H4TDrg\">Musk responded with an emoji, of course, and then quickly deleted it after just a few minutes:</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yl8r0FObTO447IPVCX6OTwcxAMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23381480/oF5bwyF.png\">      <figcaption><em>Musk’s deleted tweet.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"daSxNo\">He’s also deleted some (but not all) of the tweets he posted about Twitter between the time when he informed the board he would not take a seat and when Agrawal announced the news.</p><p id=\"6jIPrR\">One possibility that would be very distracting? A hostile takeover attempt from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/21/18150813/elon-musk-influencer-ceo-social-media-tesla-spacex\">the first influencer CEO</a>.
