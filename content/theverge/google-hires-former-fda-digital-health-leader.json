Bakul Patel spent over a decade at the FDA and most recently was the chief digital health officer of global strategy and innovation.</p><p id=\"VAjuTL\">“I am looking forward to learning from the teams in health across Google and Alphabet and helping build a unified digital health and regulatory strategy,” he wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6932012357942476800/\">Linkedin post</a> Monday announcing the move. </p><p id=\"KArwDR\">Like all big tech companies, Google has pushed further into health and healthcare over the past few years, with mixed results. Its ambitions range from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454817/google-hca-patient-data-healthcare-algorithms\">mining big data</a> for algorithms to developing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440754/google-health-ai-skin-condition-model-dermatology\">disease-detecting</a> tools to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994324/google-fitbit-heart-monitoring-afib-fda\">pumping wearables</a> full of health features. But its strategy has gone through some upheaval: the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639075/google-health-team-dispersed-strategy-change\">dissolved the Google Health division</a> in August 2021 and spread its employees around to various initiatives. The head of the division left the company.</p><p id=\"eaWNVE\">Patel is only the latest to enter the new revolving door between Alphabet and federal regulatory agencies. Current FDA Commissioner Robert Califf is a former Alphabet senior advisor. And Google’s chief health officer Karen DeSalvo is the former director of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.</p><p id=\"Sb0sMI\"></p>",
