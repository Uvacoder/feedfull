Not sure what happened — also getting lots of notifications for older posts from other Substacks.</p>— Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1512517634264289283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 8, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"vQ9fPe\">It’s unclear exactly how many emails were mistakenly duplicated, but the company explained things a bit more <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SubstackInc/status/1512535319446491141\">in a tweet</a>, saying “A recent update triggered duplicate emails for a subset of writers’ email lists. We apologize for the inconvenience to you and your readers. We’re on it, and we’ll make sure it does not happen again.”</p><p id=\"u11REA\">Of course, if you just missed the last edition of <a href=\"https://kyw.substack.com/\"><em>The Kicks You Wear</em></a> in your overstuffed inbox that is never at zero, getting a second copy is more of a helpful reminder than an annoying extra message. And if you’re troubled either by missing a subscription newsletter or receiving one copy too many, the still-in-beta <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22174000/substack-rss-reader-newsletter-subscriptions\">RSS reader</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22968832/substack-reader-app-inbox\">mobile app</a> (<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/substack-reader/id1581650857\">iOS only</a> right now, there’s a <a href=\"https://8g5zau8cti6.typeform.com/to/YPiI2mMg?typeform-source=on.substack.com\">waitlist</a> for Android users) can provide some alternate options.</p><aside id=\"jvXWvv\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Can Substack CEO Chris Best build a new model for journalism? \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22159571/substack-ceo-chris-best-interview-newsletter-subscription-model-journalism-decoder-podcast\"}]}'></div></aside>",
