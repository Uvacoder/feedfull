Since Apple launched the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features\">third-gen AirPods</a> in October and unveiled its new lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. What’s more, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even seen some significant discounts on the third-gen model that, despite lacking the “Pro” moniker, resembles the AirPods Pro more than the long-stemmed original model. </p><p id=\"eJ0Ffb\">Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.</p><aside id=\"Si36Ca\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals\"},{\"title\":\"The best deals on MacBooks right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"VFDHZw\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10742787\"></div></div><h2 id=\"ej2msf\">The best entry-level <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features\">AirPods</a> (second-gen) deals</h2><p id=\"eg29V6\">Last year, Apple lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — from $159 to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case now, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found that the easy-to-use, second-gen AirPods still offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.</p><p id=\"OtXs0h\">At the moment, the best deal on Apple’s most affordable pair of earbuds is available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D535%26%26adid%3D22222222227281354149%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D339987579106%26wl4%3Dpla-667825192756%26wl5%3D9031583%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D120820547%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D604342441%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwrqqSBhBbEiwAlQeqGllYG1vR2srxZuh99Jl31iYJGLW8w8ZwKbZvGow8d-vfz9wLxORXjxoCIgsQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&amp;subid1=TheVergeBestAirpodDealsApril42022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-2nd-generation-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097&amp;subid1=TheVergeBestAirpodDealsApril202022\">Target</a>, where you can pick them up for $99.99, roughly $10 shy of their best price to date.

The short stems make for a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.</p><p id=\"QiPrKN\">Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some worthwhile deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a MagSafe-ready charging case.

These typically retail for $249, but right now they’re available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df_free_online%26CPNG%3DElectronics%26adgroup%3D57-10&amp;subid1=TheVergeBestAirpodDealsApril202022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro-with-MagSafe-Charging-Case%2F975690481&amp;subid1=TheVergeBestAirpodDealsApril42022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart</a> for around $175. That’s not as low as the price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still $74 off what you’d pay if you were to purchase the earbuds directly from Apple.</p><div id=\"THtgJp\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9513673\"></div></div><aside id=\"GYTQGM\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"‘Pro’ has lost all meaning, and Apple knows it\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/14/22968241/apple-pro-studio-branding-creative-marketing-mac-display\"}]}'></div></aside><aside id=\"1tN9fa\"><div data-anthem-component=\"actionbox\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"title\":\"Verge Deals on Twitter\",\"description\":\"Join our over 46,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals\",\"label\":\"Follow us!\",\"url\":\"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud\"}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"x5NHYH\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods Max</a> deals</h2><p id=\"ESUeUd\">The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best noise-canceling headphones</a> for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. </p><div id=\"KBAAwB\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10361602\"></div></div><p id=\"irGZgJ\">Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 on Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Nonetheless, the headphones are currently <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Blue/dp/B08PZJN7BD/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">on sale at Amazon in every color except for green for $449</a>, one of their better prices to date.
