You can <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-0MwZPWKD4\">watch it right here</a> on HBO’s YouTube channel (via <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/um11in/season_4_trailer/\">Reddit</a>), to see that many of our android friends, foes, and friends who didn’t know they were androids will continue to have roles to play.

Launching roughly two months ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229362/hbo-max-launch-date-warnermedia-now-go-peacock-quibi-price\">debut of HBO Max</a> and squarely in the center of early coronavirus pandemic lockdowns here in the US <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/12/21063130/westworld-season-three-premiere-date-teaser-trailer-dolores-man-black-maeve-blade-runner\">on March 15th, 2020</a>, the third season didn’t quite have the impact of the first two. </p><aside id=\"3YfgTI\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Westworld S3 review: There is hope for Westworld, but you’re going to have to stick it out  \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21182067/westworld-season-3-hbo-review-evan-rachel-wood-aaron-paul\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"Amndnj\">The teaser wraps up by promising a release date for season four on June 26th, 2022. The early warning is appreciated, because now I have time to try and watch season three again. </p><p id=\"7FById\">Correction May 9th, 11:15PM ET: Updated to note the trailer link is an Easter Egg ahead of the new season, as it first popped up in an Instagram story.</p>",
