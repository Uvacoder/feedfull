According to <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/twitter-board-expected-to-fight-musk-offer\">a report from <em>The Information</em></a>, it views Elon Musk’s offer to take over the company as unwelcome. This follows Musk’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23024905/elon-musk-offers-to-buy-twitter\">offer to purchase the company</a> for $43 billion earlier today. The company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1514668390320857088\">hasn’t publicly indicated</a> how it’s planning on responding to Musk’s offer, but it’s <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/twitter-reportedly-to-hold-all-hands-meeting-with-employees-at-2-pm-pacific-to-discuss-elon-musks-bid-for-company-2022-04-14\">reportedly planning to address it at an all-hands meeting</a> at 5PM ET / 2PM PT today.</p><p id=\"wN6bkb\">Twitter’s board is also <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-elon-musk-buy-twitter-11649949297\">reportedly considering</a> using a “poison pill” strategy to make it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/twitter-can-afford-refuse-musks-41-bln-bid-2022-04-14/\">more difficult</a> for Elon to acquire a large stake in the company and avoid a hostile takeover. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/5/3603590/netflix-poison-pill-shareholder-plan-takeover\">Poison pills can, as one example</a>, flood the market with shares once an investor acquires stock above a certain limit, making them easier to acquire for others (and costly for a single investor to buy up) when someone attempts a takeover.</p><p id=\"gbL0DB\"> As <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/musk-declines-twitter-board-seat-twitters-poison-pill-the-new-york-times-twitter-reset/\">Stratechery’s Ben Thompson points out</a>, Twitter already has some poison pill provisions in its bylaws including the board’s ability to issue “blank check” preferred stock without prior approval; you can find the provisions on page 34 <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001418091/947c0c34-ca90-4099-b328-a6062adf110f.pdf\">of this PDF</a>.</p><p id=\"xvuhSi\">It’s hard to say whether Musk will be deterred by such tactics, provided he can <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23025396/elon-musk-jack-dorsey-twitter-hostile-takeover\">actually come up with the money</a> required to take the company private. In a TED interview on Thursday, he said the acquisition <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23025343/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-ted-talk-quote-stock-buyout\">wouldn’t be about making money</a> — he’s frequently cited “free speech” as the main reason for his interest in Twitter. Though, Musk has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/8/7/20758944/elon-musk-twitter-tesla-funding-secured-private-420\">promised and failed</a> to take companies private before.</p><aside id=\"UT6vis\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Elon Musk’s new troll is buying Twitter — will it work?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23025396/elon-musk-jack-dorsey-twitter-hostile-takeover\"},{\"title\":\"What else could Elon Musk buy for $43 billion?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/14/23025330/elon-musk-twitter-offer-43-billion\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"lRaawH\">In the same TED interview, Musk said he had a plan B if Twitter doesn’t accept his offer, and while he refused to explain it at TED, he may have already given us a hint. In his offer letter to Twitter’s board, he said that he would “need to reconsider [his] position as a shareholder” if the company refuses his buyout. Musk recently <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009622/elon-musk-twitter-shares-free-speech\">purchased 9.2 percent</a> of the company’s shares but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/10/23019802/elon-musk-not-joining-twitter-board-announced\">declined a position on the board</a>.</p><p id=\"nVJ9Iv\"><em><strong>Update, 3:42PM ET: </strong></em><em>Added that Twitter already has some poison pill provisions.</em></p>",
