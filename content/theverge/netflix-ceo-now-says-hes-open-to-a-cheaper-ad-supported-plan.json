Quoted by <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/04/netflix-sports-f1-1235006124/\"><em>Deadline</em></a>, he said “I’m not saying that we’ll never do sports but we’ll have to see a path to growing a big revenue stream and a great profit stream with it,” which is a significant shift from the flat no Netflix has previously offered.</p><div id=\"hfZwVf\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1abP3Eo_RA?rel=0&amp;start=1003\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><aside id=\"yVS2PL\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Netflix just lost subscribers for the first time in over a decade\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23032399/netflix-lost-subscribers-q1-2022-earnings\"},{\"title\":\"Netflix blames 100 million password sharers for stalled subscriber growth \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23032643/netflix-password-sharing-subscribers-100-million\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"2peVaM\">Netflix would be far from the only company to introduce an ad-supported tier. Competitors like Hulu, Peacock, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465317/hbo-max-ad-supported-plan\">even HBO Max</a> offer plans that let consumers pay less (or, in Peacock’s case, nothing) in return for having their shows occasionally interrupted. Disney has also announced that it’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/4/22961433/disney-plus-subscription-ad-tier-price\">adding an ad-supported option</a> to Disney Plus by the end of the year.</p><p id=\"kvpHk2\">Currently, Netflix charges $10 a month for its basic tier, $15.49 a month for its standard tier, and $20 a month for its premium tier. These prices are relatively new — the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22993562/netflix-price-increase-us-plans-2022\">bumped them up in March</a>. During the call, Hastings says he’s proud of Netflix’s “price spread,” but as we laid out in January, the company’s deep market penetration means it has limited options to try to make more money <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893419/netflix-price-increase-q1-2022-earnings\">outside of raising prices again and again</a>. Introducing a cheaper, ad-supported tier (as well as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/19/23032643/netflix-password-sharing-subscribers-100-million\">trying to cut down on password sharing</a>) could be part of the company’s plan to increase its number of customers, and introduce another revenue stream.</p><aside id=\"y9YRTm\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Now that Disney Plus is trying ads, how long until the rest of the streamers do, too?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22967831/disney-plus-ads-hbo-max-hulu-streaming\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"8IpsC8\"><em>Disclosure: </em>The Verge<em> is currently producing a series with Netflix.</em></p><p id=\"CVzz8P\"><em><strong>Update 7:18PM ET: </strong></em><em>Added note about Ted Sarandos referencing live sports.</em></p>",
