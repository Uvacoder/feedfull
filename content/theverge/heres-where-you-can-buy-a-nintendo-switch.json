It also features a D-pad and can play all the same games, except those that require detachable Joy-Con controllers (which are very few).

The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some <em>Mario Party</em> titles require the Joy-Cons to play.
