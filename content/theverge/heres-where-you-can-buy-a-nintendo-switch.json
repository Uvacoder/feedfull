The Lite only functions as a handheld console — meaning you can’t hook it up to your TV — and it’s smaller, lighter, and sturdier than its dockable counterpart. Its screen clocks in at 5.5-inches, it features a proper D-pad, and can play all the same games as the regular Switch, except those that require detachable Joy-Con controllers (which are very few). Regardless, it's a great dedicated handheld for those who prefer to game on the go.</p><ul><li id=\"CEr672\">Many retailers currently carry the Nintendo Switch Lite as a standalone console, though, the availability of certain colors is spread around.
