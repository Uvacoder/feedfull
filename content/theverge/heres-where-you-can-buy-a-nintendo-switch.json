The Lite only functions as a handheld console — meaning you can’t hook it up to your TV — and it’s smaller, lighter, and sturdier than its dockable counterpart. Its screen clocks in at 5.5-inches, it features a proper D-pad, and can play all the same games as the regular Switch, except those that require detachable Joy-Con controllers (which are very few). Regardless, it's a great handheld for those who prefer to game on the go.</p><p id=\"CEr672\">Many retailers carry the Nintendo Switch Lite as a standalone console, though, the available color selection varies by retailer. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Lite-Coral/dp/B092VT1JGD?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgUZ9vuoOet\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/nintendo-switch-lite-coral-112175/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo</a> currently have the best selection, with each offering the Switch Lite in coral, turquoise, and blue for around $199.

However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.</p><div id=\"jnXhNd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9556339\"></div></div><p id=\"9sHCpf\">First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default storage capacity, especially given each game ranges in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes. At Amazon, a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">400GB microSD card will currently set you back $44.99</a>, which is 36 percent off the typical price retail price.

The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative for playing most Switch games, though some <em>Mario Party</em> titles require the Joy-Cons to play.

Fortunately, you can save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.
