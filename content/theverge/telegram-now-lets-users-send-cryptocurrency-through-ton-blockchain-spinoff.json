In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ton_blockchain/status/1518940393370537985\">post on Twitter</a>, TON (The Open Network), announced that Telegram now supports Toncoin transactions with no fees attached. </p><p id=\"9niu8R\">TON included a short video showing how crypto transactions work on the platform. To get started, you’ll have to add <a href=\"https://t.me/wallet\">Telegram’s Wallet bot</a> to your attachment menu, which allows you to “purchase cryptocurrency by bank card, exchange, and transfer to other wallets.” </p><div id=\"CmgOl9\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You can now send <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Toncoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Toncoin</a> directly within Telegram chats!<br><br>It’s a new way to send Toncoin without transaction fees to any Telegram user. With this service, you’ll no longer need to enter long wallet addresses and wait for confirmations.<br><br>Watch the video and test the new feature! <a href=\"https://t.co/EtXSMFtJj6\">pic.twitter.com/EtXSMFtJj6</a></p>— TON (@ton_blockchain) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ton_blockchain/status/1518940393370537985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 26, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"DM5na4\">When you’re ready to send crypto, you can pull up the Wallet from your attachment menu while in a chat, enter the amount of Toncoin you want to send, confirm all the details, and then hit “Send.” Your recipient will receive the Toncoin through the chat.</p><p id=\"fsgdaZ\">In 2020, Telegram <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256407/telegram-cryptocurrency-shutdown-sec-gram\">shut down its own cryptocurrency operation</a> after facing pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The project, originally known as the Telegram Open Network (TON), was developed by Telegram CEO Pavel Durov and his brother Nikolai in 2018. A year later, the SEC <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20910587/telegram-the-gram-crypto-token-sale-1-7-billion-sec-halt\">ordered Telegram to halt its sales of Gram,</a> the token linked to the TON blockchain, after saying it failed to register the $1.7 billion in sales collected as part of its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/1/17186004/telegram-presale-open-network-app-ico-cryptocurrency-ton\">pre-Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a>.</p><p id=\"huNTlt\">Even after Telegram abandoned the TON project, a group of developers kept it afloat, renaming it The Open Network and rebranding Gram as Toncoin. <a href=\"https://t.me/durov/175\">Durov expressed</a> his support of the project last December, noting “I’m proud that the technology we created is alive and evolving... TON is still years ahead of everything else in the blockchain realm.” Earlier this month, the TON Foundation managed to <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/04/20/ton-users-donate-1b-to-advance-ecosystem-foundation-says/\">raise $1 billion in donations</a>.</p>",
