The <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/the-epic-mega-sale-for-may-2022\">Epic Mega Sale</a> runs from today until June 16th at 11AM ET / 8AM PT and encompasses an unlimited-use 25 percent off digital coupon. This coupon stacks <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale\">on top of ongoing sale prices</a>, though you can’t use it on titles priced below $14.99. Epic is also releasing four free mystery games each Thursday during the promotional period, the first of which is <a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-3\"><em>Borderlands 3</em></a>.</p><p id=\"rzINHl\">If you’ve seen or participated in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840143/epic-games-store-holiday-sale-free-games-coupon-shenmue-iii-3\">previous sales events</a> on the Epic Games Store, this may feel very familiar. A notable departure from those deals is that the coupon now offers a 25 percent discount, where it had previously provided a flat $10 off. With that change, this new Mega Sale coupon skews the best value towards pricier games, as a title costing $59.99 is discounted by $15 while a game right at the threshold of $14.99 only drops by $3.75.</p><p id=\"TnoknZ\">While the coupon amount is different this time around, the usual restrictions apply — you can’t use it on in-game content like V-Bucks for <em>Fortnight</em>, and it only qualifies on games already released on the Epic Games Store (no preorders).</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"aOmMOG\"><q><em>Borderlands 3</em> is free to add to your library on EGS and download today</q></aside></div><p id=\"3ehhT4\">Coinciding with the discount, <em>Borderlands 3</em> is free to add to your library on EGS and download today. There will be three more free games revealed on subsequent Thursdays during the promotional period. </p><p id=\"xDMuFk\">The digital coupon is applied automatically on one or more applicable games when added to your cart. Below are a few highlights of the over 1,600 games already discounted and what they will cost you once added to your cart with the additional 25 percent coupon:</p><ul><li id=\"3OwytL\"><a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/tiny-tinas-wonderlands\"><em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</em></a> is $35.99 ($24 off its regular price of $59.99)</li><li id=\"iQo5vH\"><a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/citizen-sleeper-944858\"><em>Citizen Sleeper</em></a> is $13.49 ($6.50 off its regular price of $19.99)</li><li id=\"vBfH8m\"><a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade\"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></a>, which includes the Yuffie DLC chapter, is $37.26 ($32.73 off its regular price of $69.99)</li><li id=\"gFsI5C\"><a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dying-light-2-stay-human\"><em>Dying Light 2 Stay Human</em></a> is $40.49 ($19.50 off its regular price of $59.99)</li><li id=\"eZWu3r\"><a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/salt-and-sacrifice\"><em>Salt and Sacrifice</em></a>, which released just nine days ago, is $14.99 ($5 off its regular price of $19.99)</li><li id=\"HAedli\"><a href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sifu\"><em>Sifu</em></a> is $26.99 ($13 off its regular price of $39.99)</li></ul><aside id=\"xeIN0Y\"><div data-anthem-component=\"newsletter\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"slug\":\"deals\"}'></div></aside>",
