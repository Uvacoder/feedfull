Sling the company $500 and you can have any photo or image you like printed on the unit’s double doors. You could choose a favorite piece of artwork, a child’s doodles, or just put your own face on your own fridge for no good reason at all. </p><p id=\"CXoIy7\">The option is launching for buyers sometime later this year (if you need to know the exact minute it goes live <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/bespoke/refrigerators/digital-printing/sign-up/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">you can sign up here for alerts</a>), and if you already own a Bespoke fridge, you can order the door panels separately and swap them in. The cost is $250 a panel, and Samsung says they’ll take about 8 weeks to print and ship. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfBn_xQV_yOINV1u7M6Ko7SW2qY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23562452/Bespoke_Digital_Printing_HandraiserKV_Final.gif\">      <cite>Image: Samsung</cite>      <figcaption><em>New from Samsung: create an incredibly ugly fridge. </em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"uJWHTM\">The Bespoke line of refrigerators is very much marketed by Samsung for its modularity and customization. Previously, though, you could only choose from a limited selection of colors and a few prints (in the UK, for example, you can buy units <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/uk/refrigerators/bespoke-refrigerators/platinum-jubilee-bespoke-fridge-rb7300t-344l-black-f-jubileea/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">emblazoned with the Union Jack</a> in time for Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee). </p><p id=\"xdeEUy\">Giving customers the option to add any image they like will almost certainly lead to some very, very ugly fridges sitting in peoples’ kitchens, but I suspect that is part of the feature’s charm. Samsung tells us that it’ll also be moderating the images requested by customers with a combination of automated filters and human review. They’ll be looking for copyright violations and explicit imagery, but other than that: go wild. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Uoed06YNZrJplCGGnMdVh8Hn4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23562881/Screenshot_2022_05_19_at_10.28.42.png\">      <cite>Image: Samsung</cite>      <figcaption><em>Customers can submit a design of their choice. </em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"tPNMW7\"><em><strong>Update, May 19th, 11:49AM ET: </strong></em><em>Updated story to include additional detail from Samsung regarding content moderation. </em></p>",
