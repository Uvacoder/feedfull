Like last year, that show is being presented by Iam8bit and Double Fine, the studio behind games like <em>Psychonauts</em>, <em>Grim Fandango</em>, and <em>Broken Age</em>. The <a href=\"https://www.summergamefest.com\">SGF website</a> says to “stay tuned” for its announcement of other partners that will be part of the show.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"PPn87f\"><q>Who needs E3?</q></aside></div><p id=\"3hNFfL\">The elephant in the room for this announcement is E3. Earlier this year, we heard that the gaming convention <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/31/23005138/e3-2022-online-virtual-event-canceled-covid-19\">was canceled for this year</a>. It traditionally happened around the same time that Summer Game Fest is scheduled for, but in recent years, there’s been a trend of the big game studios just holding their own press conferences or events. That seems to be the case this year as well; the Summer Game Fest website notes that on June 12th, Microsoft is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23046288/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-games-showcase-date-2022\">holding an Xbox and Bethesda games showcase</a>. </p><p id=\"qNc82M\">Keighley and others seem to be aware of the shifting landscape. Summer Game Fest was announced just as we heard about E3 being canceled, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Narz/status/1522238433518776321?s=20&amp;t=hrQ-8iTTtgdqimiDGXQNFw\">one person on Twitter</a> joked about the fest being named “Keigh3” this year. It seems that if you’re waiting for news on a game, Summer Game Fest will be the thing to watch this year. At the show last year we saw <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22307059/elden-ring-george-rr-martin-fromsoftware-e3-2021-trailer-gameplay\">an <em>Elden Ring</em> gameplay trailer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528190/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-2k-gearbox-andy-samberg-wanda-sykes-summer-game-fest\">the announcement of <em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</em></a>.</p>",
