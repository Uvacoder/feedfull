This marks the close of a lengthy battle with the city’s transportation agency, Transport for London (TfL), over Uber’s safety protocols. </p><div id=\"jMT4xr\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We’re delighted to announce <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TfL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TfL</a> has granted Uber a new 30 month licence in London.

In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459546/uber-london-appeal-ban-fit-and-proper-transport-for-london-tfl\">a judge granted Uber a license to operate in London for 18 months</a> despite the company’s “historical failings.” Over the years, Uber has added a number of safety features, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17402172/uber-911-panic-button-app-live-us\">an in-app panic button</a>, a way for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143679/uber-rider-reporting-safety-issue-driver-trip\">riders to report their drivers for unsafe behavior</a>, as well as the ability for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22814616/uber-new-safety-features-ridecheck-audio-recording\">drivers and riders to record audio</a> during trips. </p><p id=\"LBkNTO\">Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/21330906/uber-uk-supreme-court-employee-rights\">Uber lost a legal battle in the UK</a> over its drivers' employment status, requiring the company to start <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334771/uber-uk-drivers-workers-benefits-employees-decision\">classifying its UK-based drivers as employees</a>, granting them minimum wage, paid vacation, and other benefits.</p><p id=\"bAgH0p\">“As we continue to serve London, we remain focused on raising industry standards in all areas,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UberUK/status/1507643645037584387\">Uber added</a>. “These include offering drivers the benefits and protections they deserve, ensuring all Londoners can get around safely and becoming a fully electric platform by 2025.”</p>",
