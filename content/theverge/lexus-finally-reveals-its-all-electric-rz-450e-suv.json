The company’s first-ever electric vehicle (EV) will also come with Direct4. That’s its new all-wheel-drive system that automatically calibrates weight distribution on all four wheels, leading to “improved start-up acceleration, handling stability and low power consumption.”</p><p id=\"snTf5K\">On the inside of the vehicle is a sleek interior with a 14-inch touchscreen and a panoramic sunroof that extends from the front seats to the back. As for a steering yoke, which my colleague <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011587/lexus-rz-ev-date-reveal-tease-steering-yoke\">Andrew Hawkins lamented about</a> in a previous post, that’s optional. </p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wSZfrnt_AHgBjWnXiG8e7kqPow0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23404772/2023_Lexus_RZ_Interior_21_1500x1039.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Lexus</cite>      <figcaption><em>The steering yoke will be optional.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"2I0IR3\">Lexus included an image of the yoke in its initial tease of the car, but Lexus spokesperson Amanda Roark confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that Lexus will sell the vehicle in the US for one year with a standard wheel. After that, the yoke will be offered as an additional option with Steer by Wire, a feature that replaces mechanical steering with electronic controls.</p><p id=\"7euBvE\">Lexus still hasn’t revealed any pricing information for the RZ, but it’s likely that the luxury vehicle will cost a bit more than the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/12/23022385/toyota-bz4x-ev-suv-pricing-availability-announcement\">$42,000 BZ4X electric SUV offered by Toyota</a>. The base BZ4X model comes with an estimated 252 miles of range, a 71.4kWh battery pack, and is built on the same e-TNGA platform as the RZ.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/By8HtnR-FPFtkIEdbVIlh9uSvoM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23404708/2023_Lexus_RZ_Exterior_17_1500x916.jpg\">      <cite>Image: Lexus</cite>      <figcaption><em>The RZ 450e comes with a 71.4kWh battery pack, lasting an estimated 225 miles on one charge.</em></figcaption>  </figure><p id=\"XRTPny\">When compared to other electric luxury SUVs, the RZ falls a bit short on range with its 225-mile estimate. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866219/bmw-ix-m60-electric-vehicle-range-specs-date\">2022 BMW iX M60</a> lasts up to 280 miles on a single charge, while the <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/modelx\">2022 Tesla Model X</a> can cover an estimated 333 miles. The RZ’s mileage is more on par with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307699/volvo-c40-recharge-electric-vehicle-ev-specs\">$51,700 2022 Volvo XC40 Recharge</a>, which gets up to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.volvocars.com%2Fus%2Fv%2Fcars%2Fxc40-electric&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F4%2F20%2F23034490%2Flexus-rz-450e-electric-suv-direct4-awd\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">223 miles</a> on one charge.</p>",
