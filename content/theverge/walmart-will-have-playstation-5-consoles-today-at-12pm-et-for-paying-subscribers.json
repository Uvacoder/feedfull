Walmart once again has a restock of PS5 consoles coming up for Walmart Plus subscribers. The members-only drop is scheduled for <strong>today, April 19th, at 12PM ET / 9AM PT</strong>, and it’s set to include the disc-based <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;subid1=vergeconsolerestock\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PS5 for $499</a>. You’ll need a <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;subid1=vergeconsolerestock\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paid Walmart Plus account</a> to get a crack at either one (no free trials allowed), and while the premium subscription costs $98 annually, you can subscribe for just one month for $12.95 to try your hand at a PS5.</p><p id=\"BbTsQI\">We’ve been through this drill at Walmart many times before, and while nobody likes paying extra for access to purchase a console, the retail giant is one of the more reliable stores selling non-bundled consoles. This scheduled restock is no different, and both versions of the PS5 are available for their regular prices without forcing you to purchase a big bundle.</p><div id=\"xDAzpc\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10971562\"></div></div><p id=\"DUib4E\">There are a couple of things you can do to set yourself up for success. First, get your Walmart Plus account sorted ahead of time, and ensure the billing and shipping addresses you plan to use for the purchase are saved. Be ready to refresh the page right at the hour, too, but avoid the temptation to excessively refresh the page before that, as Walmart’s automated bot protection may temporarily lock you out and slow your progress. Once the “Add to Cart” button appears, click it to join the online queue.</p><p id=\"FaCSbD\">To increase your chances, you can simultaneously try to secure a console on a desktop browser and the Walmart mobile app, which can often load faster than its desktop counterpart. The lucky few who get through the queue should have 10 minutes to check out. Be sure to stay persistent and only give up once the listings say sold out, as Walmart usually funnels in more inventory every 10 minutes or so.</p><p id=\"pOqBxI\">Hopefully, many of you will be able to secure a console in today’s restock.
