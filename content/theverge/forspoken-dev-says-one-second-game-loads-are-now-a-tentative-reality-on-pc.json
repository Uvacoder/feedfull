In my experience, the fastest load times I’ve seen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WZ3pTe61O4\">were on <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> on a PS5</a>, which can take just 10 seconds from the time you leave the PS5’s home screen to the time you can move your character, four to five times faster than on PS4. It’s not clear if <em>Forspoken</em> is counting from app launch to playable gameplay or not.</p><div id=\"1VvYr4\"><div ><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WZ3pTe61O4?rel=0\"  allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;\"></iframe></div></div><p id=\"BeKOKJ\">With <em>Forspoken</em>, Ono says they’re using other techniques to speed up load times as well, such as loading the game in advance while you’re on the title screen.</p><p id=\"rOfxVd\">AMD also revealed today <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22993152/amd-fsr-2-0-xbox-nvidia-gpus\">that <em>Forspoken</em> will support FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.0</a> temporal upscaling for higher effective resolutions or faster framerates, which the team says took less than a week to integrate into the game. </p><aside id=\"Sa1KrD\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"AMD says its framerate-boosting FSR 2.0 is also headed to Xbox and these Nvidia graphics cards\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22993152/amd-fsr-2-0-xbox-nvidia-gpus\"},{\"title\":\"One of the Steam Deck’s best features just came to an AMD GPU near you\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/17/22982473/amd-radeon-steam-deck-features-super-resolution-fsr-2-0\"}]}'></div></aside>",
