WhatsApp appears to be rolling out the feature on Android in phases, and we were unable to get it to appear ourselves.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\">  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mav7uNSn49GXwy_ffq0ix8lRwQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23336440/WA_MESSAGE_REACTION_ANIMATION.gif\">      <cite>Image: <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-rolling-out-message-reactions/\" target=\"_blank\">WABetaInfo</a></cite>      <figcaption><em>The emoji reaction feature in action.</em></figcaption>  </figure></div><p id=\"j95kHc\">Alongside its appearance on Android, there are signs that emoji reactions are also on the way for the service’s iOS and desktop applications. As of <a href=\"https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-messenger-beta-for-ios-22-2-72-whats-new/\">early January</a> WhatsApp’s beta app on iOS has had a settings toggle to control “Reaction Notifications,” and a similar setting appeared in the <a href=\"https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-desktop-beta-2-2210-1-whats-new/\">beta version of the desktop app</a> earlier this month.</p><p id=\"jTcPIz\">Emoji reactions have become commonplace across other messaging services like iMessage, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/23/15033810/facebook-messenger-notifications-reactions\">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336079/google-messages-reply-emoji-reactions-smart-reply-sticker\">Google’s Messages app</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21078282/twitter-direct-messages-dms-emoji-reactions\">even Twitter DMs</a>. Now, finally, one of the world’s most popular messaging apps is getting in on the action. </p><p id=\"bAD0pY\"></p>",
