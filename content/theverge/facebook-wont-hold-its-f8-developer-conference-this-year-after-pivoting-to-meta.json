Moreira also said there will be another Connect event “later this year” focused on the company’s “VR, AR, and metaverse platform offerings.” At the October 2021 Connect, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand\">Facebook announced its rebrand to Meta</a>, so it seems likely the company will have some big news to share at that event.</p><p id=\"K5sPWO\">Other big tech conferences are moving forward in the coming months. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981868/google-i-o-2022-may-11th-12th-online-virtual\">Google I/O will take place May 11th and 12th</a>, while Apple just announced on Tuesday that the 2022 Worldwide Developers Conference <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/22984508/apple-wwdc-2022-event-date-software-updates-ios-ipados-macos\">is set for June 6th through 10th</a>.
