T-Mobile confirmed the attack in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, and says the “systems accessed contained no customer or government information or other similarly sensitive information.”</p><p id=\"75lntS\">In copies of private messages obtained by Krebs, the Lapsus$ hacking group discussed targeting T-Mobile in the week prior to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994563/lapsus-hacking-group-london-police-arrest-microsoft-nvidia\">the arrest of seven of its teenage members</a>. After purchasing employees’ credentials online, the members could use the company’s internal tools — like Atlas, T-Mobile’s customer management system — to perform SIM swaps. This type of attack involves hijacking a target’s mobile phone by transferring its number to a device owned by the attacker. From there, the attacker can obtain texts or calls received by that person’s phone number, including any messages sent for multi-factor authentication. </p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"8pyVY8\"><q>Lapsus$ hackers also attempted to crack into the FBI and Department of Defense’s T-Mobile accounts</q></aside></div><p id=\"APQwh4\">According to screenshotted messages posted by Krebs, Lapsus$ hackers also attempted to crack into the FBI and Department of Defense’s T-Mobile accounts. They were ultimately unable to do so, as additional verification measures were required.</p><p id=\"4J4eYo\">“Several weeks ago, our monitoring tools detected a bad actor using stolen credentials to access internal systems that house operational tools software,” T-Mobile said in an emailed statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “Our systems and processes worked as designed, the intrusion was rapidly shut down and closed off, and the compromised credentials used were rendered obsolete.”</p><p id=\"JL1t6G\">T-Mobile has been the victim of several attacks over the years. Although this particular hack didn’t affect customers’ data, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17776836/tmobile-hack-data-breach-personal-information-two-million-customers\">past</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security\">incidents</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20978498/tmobile-security-disclosed-breach-prepaid-customers\">did</a>. In August 2021, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii\">a breach exposed the personal information</a> belonging to over 47 million customers, while another attack occurring just months later <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22857619/t-mobile-cyberattack-data-breach-december-2021-cpni-sim-swap\">compromised “a small number” of customer accounts</a>.</p><p id=\"rCTG4A\">Lapsus$ has made a name for itself as a hacking group that primarily targets the source code of large technology companies, like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991409/lapsus-microsoft-security-windows-source-code\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/7/22965220/samsung-hack-lapsus-galaxy-source-code-confirmed-nvidia\">Samsung</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22957212/nvidia-confirms-hack-proprietary-information-lapsus\">Nvidia</a>. The group, which is reportedly led by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22993731/lapsus-hacking-group-teenager-mastermind\">a teenage mastermind</a>, has also targeted <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22972768/ubisoft-cyber-security-incident-hack\">Ubisoft</a>, Apple Health partner <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/30/23003194/lapsus-gang-new-hack-apple-facebook-globant\">Globant</a>, and authentication company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22990637/okta-breach-single-sign-on-lapsus-hacker-group\">Okta</a>.</p>",
