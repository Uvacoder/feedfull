Our enquiries remain ongoing.”</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"1xssPZ\"><q>Lapsus$ has taken responsibility for some major security breaches</q></aside></div><p id=\"zSfhBZ\">Lapsus$ has taken responsibility for some major security breaches at tech companies, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22957212/nvidia-confirms-hack-proprietary-information-lapsus\">Nvidia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/7/22965220/samsung-hack-lapsus-galaxy-source-code-confirmed-nvidia\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22972768/ubisoft-cyber-security-incident-hack\">Ubisoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22990637/okta-breach-single-sign-on-lapsus-hacker-group\">Okta</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/22/22991409/lapsus-microsoft-security-windows-source-code\">Microsoft</a>. On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22993731/lapsus-hacking-group-teenager-mastermind\">reports surfaced</a> indicating an Oxford-based teenager is the mastermind of the group. City of London Police did not say if this teenager was among those arrested<em>.</em> </p><p id=\"gaAm1v\">At least one member of Lapsus$ was also apparently involved with a data breach at EA,  <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/a-closer-look-at-the-lapsus-data-extortion-group/\">cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs reported</a> on Wednesday in an extensive article about the group. <em>Vice</em> corroborated the group’s involvement in that breach in its own article <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/3abedn/who-is-lapsus-hacking-gang\">on Thursday</a>, noting that it was “emblematic of Lapsus$’s subsequent and massive hacks.”</p><p id=\"rSoxt6\">The suspected mastermind’s identity was apparently revealed by angry customers doxing him. According to Krebs’ report, the group’s leader purchased Doxbin, a site where people can share or find personal information on others, last year, but was a poor owner of the site. He apparently gave up control in January but leaked “the entire Doxbin data set” to Telegram, and the Doxbin community retaliated by doxing him.</p><p id=\"c5Uxqc\"><em>BBC News</em> says it spoke to the teenager’s father, who was apparently unaware of his involvement with the group. “I had never heard about any of this until recently. He’s never talked about any hacking, but he is very good on computers and spends a lot of time on the computer,” the father said, according to <em>BBC News</em>. “I always thought he was playing games. We’re going to try to stop him from going on computers.”</p><aside id=\"ocZP7E\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"A teen is reportedly the mastermind behind the Lapsus$ hacking group \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22993731/lapsus-hacking-group-teenager-mastermind\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"GpEiah\"><em><strong>Update March 24th, 12:05PM ET</strong></em><em>: Added City of London Police statement and additional context about the group.</em></p>",
