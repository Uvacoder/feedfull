  "description": "Amazon, Google, IBM, and many others are racing to create a practical quantum computer from a variety of qubit platforms. However, all qubits today are extraordinarily fragile to outside interference. Individual electrons floating above a surface of frozen neon offer a tantalizing new technology.",
