  "description": "SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), of which SHA-256 is a part, is one of the most popular hash algorithms around. A cryptographic hash, also often referred to as a “digest”, “fingerprint” or “signature”, is an almost perfectly unique string of characters that is generated from a separate piece of input text. For example, SHA-256 generates a 256-bit (32-byte) signature.\nFurther down in this article, we will break down each step of SHA 256’s cryptographic algorithm and work through a real example by hand.",
