  "description": "The Cacowards are an annual feature at Doomworld, released on Doom's birthday, to recognize the year's best mods.  Stephen Browning (Scuba Steve) is credited with the original concept.  The series started in 2004 with the so-called 11th edition, which attempted to replicate the success of similar articles in the previous year's 10 Years of Doom celebration, the Top 100 WADs of All Time and the Top 10 Infamous WADs.  The 28th (actually 18th) installment appeared in 2021.",
