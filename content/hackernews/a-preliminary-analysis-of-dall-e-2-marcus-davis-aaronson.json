  "description": "The DALL-E 2 system generates original synthetic images corresponding to an\ninput text as caption. We report here on the outcome of fourteen tests of this\nsystem designed to assess its common sense, reasoning and ability to understand\ncomplex texts. All of our prompts were intentionally much more challenging than\nthe typical ones that have been showcased in recent weeks. Nevertheless, for 5\nout of the 14 prompts, at least one of the ten images fully satisfied our\nrequests. On the other hand, on no prompt did all of the ten images satisfy our\nrequests.",
