  "description": "A community of developers has formed to modernize the Fortran ecosystem. In\nthis article, we describe the high-level features of Fortran that continue to\nmake it a good choice for scientists and engineers in the 21st century. Ongoing\nefforts include the development of a Fortran standard library and package\nmanager, the fostering of a friendly and welcoming online community, improved\ncompiler support, and language feature development. The lessons learned are\ncommon across contemporary programming languages and help reduce the learning\ncurve and increase adoption of Fortran.",
