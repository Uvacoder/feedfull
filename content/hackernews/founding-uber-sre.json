  "description": "This is my personal story of starting the SRE organization at Uber. If you want advice rather than reminiscence, take a look at Trunk and Branches Model and Productivity in the age of hypergrowth.\nAfter I left SocialCode in 2014, I spent a month interviewing at a handful of companies trying to figure out what to do next.
