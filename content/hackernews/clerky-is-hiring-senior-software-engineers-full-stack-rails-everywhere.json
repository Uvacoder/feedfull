  "description": "Help fix the legal industry! The way legal paperwork gets done is filled with inefficiencies, which leads to ridiculously high legal fees. We fix this by building software that automates and streamlines the process. We're profitable and growing sustainably. We're the most popular way for high-growth technology startups to form, and are also used by tons of top-tier startups for hiring and fundraising. Our software is more advanced than any other online legal service. We've invested a lot in architecture, maintainability, and testing, giving us a significant advantage as we build out functionality that founders and attorneys can currently only dream of. We're a quiet leader in the legal technology space â€” if you are interested in changing the legal industry, this is arguably the best place to be.",
