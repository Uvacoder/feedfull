  "description": "Even after 10 years of programming, I still have a relentless curiosity about new software algorithms, reading papers and blog posts, and learning from other engineers. The best part, however, really comes when you have the opportunity to implement one algorithm and even customize it for your specific use case. In this post, I will walk you through my journey from understanding cluster membership fundamentals to the implementation of Chitchat, our Rust implementation of the Scuttlebutt algorithm with a phi accrual failure detector.",
