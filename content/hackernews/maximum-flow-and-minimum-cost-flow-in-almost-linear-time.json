  "description": "We give an algorithm that computes exact maximum flows and minimum-cost flows\non directed graphs with $m$ edges and polynomially bounded integral demands,\ncosts, and capacities in $m^{1+o(1)}$ time. Our algorithm builds the flow\nthrough a sequence of $m^{1+o(1)}$ approximate undirected minimum-ratio cycles,\neach of which is computed and processed in amortized $m^{o(1)}$ time using a\ndynamic data structure.\n  Our framework extends to an algorithm running in $m^{1+o(1)}$ time for\ncomputing flows that minimize general edge-separable convex functions to high\naccuracy. This gives an almost-linear time algorithm for several problems\nincluding entropy-regularized optimal transport, matrix scaling, $p$-norm\nflows, and isotonic regression.",
