  "description": "Paying attention to beginner questions is important. While many are just re-hashes of things that books have explained 1000 times, some are quite interesting, like this one that I saw recently in a Reddit post:\n How do I determine when to use i8-64 (same for u8-64)?\n Now, here is a surprisingly hard question. It&rsquo;s really easy to find out what i16 and u8 and friends mean, and what they do: the appropriate section comes really early in The Book.",
