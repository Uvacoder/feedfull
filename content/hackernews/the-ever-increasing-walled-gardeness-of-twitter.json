  "description": "Up until a few years ago, I used to feel good when sharing Twitter links. Compared to the other handful of websites that now make up our entire lives, it was the best option:\n Not a walled garden like Facebook or Instagram where you either don’t see any content at all or are bombarded with “sign up to continue” popups after scrolling down more than ten pixels. Not horribly confusing and overwhelming for people that don’t use it regularly like Reddit, be it the old or the bad design.",
