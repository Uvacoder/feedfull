  "description": "Global rideshare giant Uber has admitted that it had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and that it had made false and misleading representations via its Uber app and has agreed to a $26 million fine. In a case brought to the Federal Court by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, Uber admitted that it had breached Australian Consumer Law by making false or misleading statement in its cancellation warning messages, as well as its Uber Taxi fare estimates. The company agreed to make joint submissions with the ACCC to the court for penalties totaling $26 million to be imposed. Although both the ACCC and Uber have agreed to the $26 million penalties and will present this figure to the court as a joint submission, it remains the courts decision whether this is an adequate penalty.",
