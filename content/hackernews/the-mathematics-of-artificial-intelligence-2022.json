  "description": "We currently witness the spectacular success of artificial intelligence in\nboth science and public life. However, the development of a rigorous\nmathematical foundation is still at an early stage. In this survey article,\nwhich is based on an invited lecture at the International Congress of\nMathematicians 2022, we will in particular focus on the current \"workhorse\" of\nartificial intelligence, namely deep neural networks. We will present the main\ntheoretical directions along with several exemplary results and discuss key\nopen problems.",
