  "description": "You may have heard the saying “This is chess, not checkers,” implying we’re involved in a situation that requires analysis and foresight. It’s been said in all kinds of contexts - in the movie Training Day about undercover police work, CEOs when running major corporations, boxing commentators talking about the sweet science, and NFL head coaches talking about game plans. The basic idea of this saying is that the activity (that you’re comparing to chess) is complex, that it isn’t a simple matter like checkers. You not only have to think many steps ahead, you have to plan and react to what your opponent does.",
