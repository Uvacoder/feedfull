  "description": "On this day in 2014 \"lame april fools' jokes\" were banned from hacker news.\n\n Today in our first This-Day-in-History segment, I want to share some of history not just of April Fools', but of tech pranks in general, all leading up to 2014.\n\n Why were pranks and April Fools' jokes traditionally celebrated in tech?

Those are today's questions.\n\n  * Episode Page\n  * Support The Show\n  * Subscribe To The Podcast\n  * Join The Newsletter",
