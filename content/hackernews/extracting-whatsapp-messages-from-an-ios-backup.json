  "description": "Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I was recently exploring how to get a local backup of WhatsApp messages from my iPhone. I switched from Android to iOS in the past and lost all of my WhatsApp messages. I wanted to make sure that if I switched again from iOS to Android I donâ€™t lose any messages. I donâ€™t really care if I can import the messages in WhatsApp. I just donâ€™t want to lose all of the important information I have in my chats.",
