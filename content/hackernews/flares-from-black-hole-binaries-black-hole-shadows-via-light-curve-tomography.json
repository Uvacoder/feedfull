  "description": "Supermassive black hole (BH) binaries are thought to produce self-lensing\nflares (SLF) when the two BHs are aligned with the line-of-sight. If the binary\norbit is observed nearly edge-on, we find a distinct feature in the light curve\nimprinted by the BH shadow from the lensed BH. We study this feature by\nray-tracing in a binary model and predict that 1\\% of the current binary\ncandidates could show this feature. Our BH tomography method proposed here\ncould make it possible to extract BH shadows that are spatially unresolvable by\nhigh-resolution VLBI.",
