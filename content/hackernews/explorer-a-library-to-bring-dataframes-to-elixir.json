  "description": "Tuesday night, I published v0.1.0 of Explorer, a library I&rsquo;ve been working on to bring dataframes to Elixir. It&rsquo;s been available through GitHub for a while, but the Hex release is more than just a milestone: by publishing the package on Hex, we&rsquo;ve enabled Rustler Precompiled to do its thing. That means that now you can use Explorer without a Rust toolchain installed and without waiting for it to compile. Before you&rsquo;d wait for up to five minutes to try it out, and now it&rsquo;s basically instant.",
