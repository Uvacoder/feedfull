  "description": "It’s been a while since I was on the receiving end of a software engineering\ninterview. But I still remember my favorite interview question. It was at MemSQL circa 2013.\n(They haven’t even kept their name,\nso I assume they’re not still relying on this specific interview question.\nI don’t feel bad for revealing it. It’s a great story that I tell people a lot;\nI’ve just never blogged it before.)\n\n",
