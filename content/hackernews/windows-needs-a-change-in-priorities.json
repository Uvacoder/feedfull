  "description": "We need to talk about Windows priorities as a product. And I am saying this as someone who wants Windows to succeed - it's a great OS that, despite it's naysayers, is still one of the best when it comes to backwards compatibility and richness of functionality. I mean, I can literally run a game written for Windows 95 on Windows 11 without major issues.",
