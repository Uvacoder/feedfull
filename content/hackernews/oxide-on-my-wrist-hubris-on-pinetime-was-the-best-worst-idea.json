  "description": "In my last Oxide-related post I got Oxide’s Propolis software running and said I might try and get their sled agent up and running next. Anyways that didn’t happen. Instead I ended up reading datasheets, writing rust codegen, spending 16 gigs of ram for an hour to build docs for a crate that’s just a glorified bundle of pointers, dreaming about serial data transfer, and uploading code to my smart watch over the slowest debug link I’ve ever had the displeasure of using. *Record Scratch* You’re probably wondering how I got in this situation. Well, it all started when I learned the nRF52832 microcontroller has a memory protection unit.",
