  "description": "Sophisticated attackers find bugs in software, evaluate their exploitability,\nand then create and launch exploits for bugs found to be exploitable. Most\nefforts to secure software attempt either to eliminate bugs or to add\nmitigations that make exploitation more difficult. In this paper, we introduce\na new defensive technique called chaff bugs, which instead target the bug\ndiscovery and exploit creation stages of this process. Rather than eliminating\nbugs, we instead add large numbers of bugs that are provably (but not\nobviously) non-exploitable. Attackers who attempt to find and exploit bugs in\nsoftware will, with high probability, find an intentionally placed\nnon-exploitable bug and waste precious resources in trying to build a working\nexploit. We develop two strategies for ensuring non-exploitability and use them\nto automatically add thousands of non-exploitable bugs to real-world software\nsuch as nginx and libFLAC; we show that the functionality of the software is\nnot harmed and demonstrate that our bugs look exploitable to current triage\ntools. We believe that chaff bugs can serve as an effective deterrent against\nboth human attackers and automated Cyber Reasoning Systems (CRSes).",
