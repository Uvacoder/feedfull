  "description": "A little workshop in Minokamo City, central Japan receives countless requests from across Japan to repair damaged clothes. Kaketsugi, or invisible mending, is a technique for repairing holes or tears in fabric. The shop is run by a father-and-daughter team: Kataoka Tesshu, with 40 years of experience as a craftsman, and his daughter Goto Yoshiko. The pair research weaving patterns in fabrics and are able to use a needle to accurately weave threads into gaps as small as 0.1 millimeter. The program follows them as they restore the cherished garments they receive.",
