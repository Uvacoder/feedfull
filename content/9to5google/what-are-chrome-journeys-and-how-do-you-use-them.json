This feature would allow users to utilize their Chrome history in a more impactful way by showing you not only the sites you’ve visited recently, but how you got there and what you found along the way. Sound cool? This guide will take you through Chrome Journeys and explain how to use the feature.</p><p> <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/05/04/what-are-chrome-journeys/#more-499491\" class=\"more-link\">more…</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/05/04/what-are-chrome-journeys/\">What are Chrome Journeys and how do you use them?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5google.com\">9to5Google</a>.</p>",
