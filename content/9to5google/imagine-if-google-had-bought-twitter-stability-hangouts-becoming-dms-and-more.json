This led to a <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2022/04/11/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-walks-away-twitter-board-hostile-takeover/\">rejected board seat</a> and this morning’s <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2022/04/14/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-makes-final-offer-to-buy-twitter-take-private/\">acquisition attempt</a>, complete with “Plan B” if/when the board rejects. Decrees-by-tweet and hostile takeovers cannot be a sustainable way to run a product, and these events play into my long-held belief that Google should have bought Twitter years ago. It would have certainly been a more orthodox turn of events compared to what’s going to play out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514698036760530945\">very publicly</a> over the coming weeks. </p><p> <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/04/14/google-twitter-past-acquisition/#more-495393\" class=\"more-link\">more…</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/04/14/google-twitter-past-acquisition/\">Imagine if Google had bought Twitter: stability, Hangouts becoming DMs, and more</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://9to5google.com\">9to5Google</a>.</p>",
