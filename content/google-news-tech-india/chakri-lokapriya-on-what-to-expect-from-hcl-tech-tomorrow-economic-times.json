  "description": "“As long as the size of the deals going forward is bigger than what it was in the previous year, we are fine and that is what I think we are expecting in the case of HCL Technology. Like in other IT stocks, if HCL Technologies misses margins from the guidance, there is bound to be some amount of weakness but the story is intact over the next year. IT as a sector and HCL Technologies in particular will actually do very well.”",
