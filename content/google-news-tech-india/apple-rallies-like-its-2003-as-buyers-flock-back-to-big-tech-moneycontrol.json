  "description": "Apple rose for an 11th-consecutive day in New York, climbing 1.9% to close at $178.96 and roughly $3 shy of a closing record reached in early January. The longest-winning streak since 2003 sent the stock back into the green for the year, and follows similar breakouts in Nvidia Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in the past week.",
