  "description": "Even as the index is in oversold territory, as suggested by the 14-day RSI reading of 27, analysts said the trend broadly stays negative and the index could retest a swing low of 15,670 sooner than later. For the day, the index closed at 15,808, down 359 points or 2.22 per cent.",
