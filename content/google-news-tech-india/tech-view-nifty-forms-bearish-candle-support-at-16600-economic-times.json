  "description": "Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said Thursday's movement indicates a lack of strength to sustain the highs. \"But, it also signals a halt in a sharp follow-through weakness after a sharp downside breakout of the 16,800 level in the previous session. If Nifty50 manages to sustain above 16,600 level and shows upside bounce from here, then one may expect chances of upside bounce in the market,\" Shetti said.",
