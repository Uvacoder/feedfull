  "description": "Before starting Class, a Zoom-friendly virtual instruction tool, Michael Chasen was the founder of Blackboard, one of the first cloud solutions for education on the market.

Class tells TechCrunch that it has acquired Collaborate, Blackboard's virtual class tool for an undisclosed price.",
