  "description": "ATLANTA, Ga. – The Clemson Tigers (8-8, 0-5 ACC) challenged Georgia Tech (7-7, 2-3 ACC) at Byers Tennis Complex but ultimately fell 7-0 on Wednesday night. Georgia Tech came ready to defend their own court, winning the doubles point by first securing the victory on Court 1 courtesy of No. 7 Yellow Jacket pair, Martin and McDaniel. Shortly after another Georgia Tech victory on Court 3 solidified the point. The Tigers didn’t go away quietly as Ryuhei Azuma took the first set with Teodor Giusca fighting on Court 1 up 3-2 in the second, but victories on Courts 3, 4 and 5 clinched the match, 4-0. Up next, the Tigers will host Boston College and Elon at the Duckworth Family Tennis Facility on Sunday, March 27 for another doubleheader. First serve against the Eagles will be at 11:00 a.m. while the Tigers will play Elon at 4:00 p.m. For complete coverage of the Clemson men’s tennis team, follow @ClemsonMTennis on Twitter and Instagram.  ",
