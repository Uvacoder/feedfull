  "description": "MARTIN, Tenn. – The 2022 season has had a great start for the Tennessee Tech softball team, taking a 17-6 record through the first month of the campaign and rifling off eight straight victories. \n\nIt’s an interesting thought – especially with the Golden Eagles picked seventh in the Ohio Valley Conference preseason poll – on just where the Tech squad could prove themselves to be. \n\nOVC play begins this weekend and the Golden Eagles make a trek over to UT Martin with a single game on Saturday and a doubleheader on Sunday, giving Tech an opportunity to show just what they’re capable of. ",
