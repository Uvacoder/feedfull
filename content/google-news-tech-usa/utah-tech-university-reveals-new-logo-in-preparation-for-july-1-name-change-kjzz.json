  "description": "Utah Tech University has unveiled a new logo in advance of its name change coming up on July 1. The legislature allocated $3 million to Utah Tech University for the logo change.  UTU intends to replace all signs by the Fall 2022 semester. Alumni that wish to get an updated diploma (from DSU to UTU) can make the request through the University's website. The shape of Utah is in the first \"U,\" and the number \"1\" is on the left side of the \"U\".",
