  "description": "LUBBOCK, Texas – Junior Andrew Morris set the stage for No. 4 Texas Tech to walk away with a 6-3 win against Kansas State on Friday night at Rip Griffin Park. Morris fanned nine batters (watch), and walked zero, in seven innings of work before the bullpen took over to earn the Red Raiders its 25th win of the season in front of a sold-out crowd.",
