  "description": "At Georgia Tech, just about everyone, from research faculty to student employees, at some point needs to make a purchase using Georgia Tech funds. While the funding sources may vary (thatâ€™s a story for another day), as a state agency Georgia Tech must follow state procurement rules, including obtaining and documenting approvals to make purchases. It is an integral part of being responsible stewards of taxpayer resources. But if you spend any time reading about these rules and regulations, you quickly learn to appreciate the complexity of seemingly simple purchases.",
