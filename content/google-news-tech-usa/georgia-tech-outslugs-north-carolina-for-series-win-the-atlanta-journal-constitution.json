  "description": "The winner of Georgia Tech’s road series at North Carolina this weekend wasn’t the team that hit .341 for the series and launched eight home runs. Rather, it was the team that hit 10 home runs, chased two starting pitchers before they could get to end of the second inning and thrashed one of the top pitching staffs in the country. That would be the Yellow Jackets, who won their second ACC series in a row by defeating the Tar Heels 15-12 on Friday and 11-8 on Sunday between a 10-5 loss on Saturday.",
