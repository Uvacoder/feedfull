  "description": "COOKEVILLE, Tenn. – Alyssa Arden was just two outs away from her fourth career no-hitter, leading Belmont 1-0 in the top of the seventh inning during Friday’s second game. However, the Bruins spoiled that and more, going on to sweep the Golden Eagles in the twinbill.\n\nElison Ollinger hit a solo home run to break up the no-hit bid, then drove in two more in the eighth inning as the Bruins earned a 5-1 victory in eight innings in game one. She finished the night with five RBI as she also had a two-run home run in the first inning of game two.\n\nAfter the Golden Eagles tied the game in the second inning, the Bruins struck for nine runs in the top of the fifth inning as Belmont collected seven straight hits and tallied nine total in the frame to force the run rule in the nightcap, topping Tech 13-4.",
