However, there was too much theory and concepts before reaching a point where you started to work on actual projects. Too much waiting before the real fun started.</p><p>So this year I decided to revisit everything and make the bootcamp much more oriented towards <strong>projects</strong>.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll learn just the tiny bit of theory and concepts you need to get started, then we&rsquo;ll 100% focus on the practical parts. </p><p>All the projects will use the same stack with React and Next.js backed by PostgreSQL and Prisma as a data layer. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that repetition and constant, consistent effort leads to results. This is the reason why we&rsquo;ll focus on one single set of technologies that you&rsquo;ll master.</p><p>And after 20 weeks you&rsquo;ll be so skilled and confident that you&rsquo;ll be able to create projects while you sleep. </p><p>If you do it well, following the projects week after week and working on the exercises I propose, you&rsquo;ll build an amazing portfolio of apps that you&rsquo;ll be able to showcase at your next job interview.</p><p>And there&rsquo;s always time to learn that particular niche feature I did not explain in the bootcamp, because you&rsquo;ll be hired at that cool company and you&rsquo;ll have all the time to learn on the job.</p><p>This morning I spent some time to prepare and publish the official schedule.</p><p>Here we go.</p><p><code>April 04</code> <strong>Week 1</strong> <strong>HTML and the basics</strong></p><p>We’ll start from absolute zero.
