And of course we&rsquo;ll let people change the details of the products they put up for sale.</p><p><img src=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-10 at 16.17.25.png\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>This is a fun project to make, as it&rsquo;s a two-sided marketplace. We have to think 2 different experiences.</p><p>And it&rsquo;s a project that you can easily expand upon, and I&rsquo;ll offer some interesting expansion opportunities.</p><p>For example with sales data you can spend some time to integrate a chart that shows the last 30 days sales.</p><p>And it can be the start of a profitable business for yourself too, if you happen to notice a market that might need a service like this but is underserved.</p><p>As with all the bootcamp projects, you&rsquo;ll have the final source code of the project available and you can freely use that in your portfolio or as the base for your projects.</p><p>Remember to sign up to the waiting list at <a href=\"https://bootcamp.dev\">https://bootcamp.dev</a></p>      ",
